# Acknowledgments

My thanks go to all those whose patient company allowed this work to take shape. A very special thanks to my mother, Dorothy Byledbal, my first passionate reader, for her long and patient work of proofreading, and to my attentive friend Sylvain Delattre for crafting the title of this book.
