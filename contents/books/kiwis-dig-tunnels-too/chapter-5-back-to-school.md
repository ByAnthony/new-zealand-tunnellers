# Chapter 5: Back to School

The French trenches into which Jim’s team ventured on 16&nbsp;March 1916 teemed with activity in a fairly confined sector. In places they formed a multitude of junctions, with no signposts to guide soldiers through the maze of ditches. Not without humour, the sector was dubbed the &ldquo;Labyrinth&rdquo;. These trenches lay north of Arras, the prefecture of the Pas-de-Calais, stretching from the Vimy Ridge in the north down to the village of Roclincourt in the south. They were the remnants of the bloody fighting of autumn 1915 between French and German forces. The enemy dominated the sector, encircling Roclincourt from north to south and running down as far as Saint-Laurent-Blangy, on the outskirts of Arras.

The trenches dug by the French soldiers were very deep, to keep them out of the enemy’s view. The defensive system had suffered badly, however, and in that winter season the trenches and the surrounding ground were nothing but a soupy mire.[^1] As elsewhere in Artois, the atmosphere behind the lines was distinctive. The French soldiers’ horizon-blue uniforms stood alongside the khaki of the British troops. The French were handing over their positions in Artois to their ally, allowing Britain to unify the fronts of Flanders and the Somme. Intense activity filled the snow-covered roads near Arras: the French, carrying all their equipment, were gradually leaving the trenches, while the British took up their new sector and brought in their own matériel.

Jim’s team relieved the French sappers of Company 7/1&nbsp;T, a Territorial engineer unit, in their tunnels east of the old Lille road, near the village of Écurie. Their officers were put in contact with their French counterparts responsible for underground operations in this sector—among them Captain Josef, probably the only one able to speak English. It was decided that the handover would be carried out gradually, and that the section west of the Lille road would remain under French control until 27&nbsp;March 1916. This interval would allow the tunnellers to establish their billets at Anzin, west of Arras, and above all to send some of their men to the British Third Army’s mining school to receive training in underground warfare. In the trenches, Jim and Lofty took over one of the six saps, numbered from east to west G0 to G5, which ran out towards the German front. On 9&nbsp;March, a French mine explosion had destroyed tunnel G1 and damaged the forward section of gallery G2.[^2] The other tunnels had reached a depth of 11 to 12&nbsp;metres. Each sap was entered via a narrow shaft set back from the front line, so that the galleries running under No Man’s Land were between 60 and 80&nbsp;metres long.[^3] On the other side of the Lille road, the French sappers continued their work while awaiting the New Zealanders’ final takeover. Five main galleries occupied them; the deepest reached about ten metres and extended nearly 30&nbsp;metres into No Man’s Land. Opposite, the Germans had been very active near the old road, where they had fired a mine on 10&nbsp;March.[^4] Listening posts along the front showed that an enemy tunnel ran beneath the northernmost sap in the sector. To the south, the other four galleries were relatively safe. The enemy was located only about twenty metres in front of the sapheads.

The first hours in the Labyrinth were hard on Jim’s team. The trenches were packed with French and British soldiers shifting their belongings, matériel, and equipment. Moving through the communication trenches was exhausting and slowed to a crawl by men constantly crossing one another. Underground, things were little better. The French galleries were very small—barely 80&nbsp;centimetres high and 65&nbsp;centimetres wide[^5]—far too tight for Jim and Lofty, who compared them to rabbit warrens. Fortunately for them, they were among the first group of men to leave the combat zone for the mining school. Delighted to get away from the vermin they had only just encountered in their billets, Jim and Lofty were loaded into a lorry with a few comrades and driven to the vicinity of the villages of Méricourt and Ribemont, on either side of the River Somme, about ten kilometres behind the front. In the billet where the two sappers were quartered, men from different tunnelling companies mixed together. A Scotsman quickly became the New Zealanders’ favourite. He had served in the infantry and had taken part in the very first British engagement at the end of August 1914, at Mons in Belgium. Jim seized the chance to question him about the Angels of Mons[^6]—a well-known legend that had travelled the world, telling of angels appearing at the decisive moment of the battle to protect British forces, outnumbered and overwhelmed by the Germans. The Scotsman did not deny it and swore he had seen them, like many other soldiers. Jim drank in his words, while others, sceptical, paid them little attention. The next morning, Jim and Lofty began, with their classmates, the ten-day training course of the general mining curriculum.

Underground warfare was an armed struggle waged in the ground beneath the space separating the opposing front-line trenches. As subterranean networks rapidly spread beneath No Man’s Land, the original purpose of underground warfare was sometimes lost from view: to destroy the enemy’s trenches from below. From then on, attacker and defender fought a true battle under No Man’s Land to secure their own underground safety and prevent the enemy from slipping through to their front line. From the trenches, men drove a main gallery—a kind of trunk—from which the various fighting branches spread out like the limbs of a tree.[^7] These tunnels were not dug or driven at random. They were guided by listening carried out with the naked ear, but more often with listening devices that amplified sounds and made it possible to locate the enemy.

The tunnellers very quickly learned to use the geophone, the listening device of choice. Built on the same principle as a stethoscope, it picked up ground vibrations through two bell-shaped receivers and amplified them to the user’s ears. In this way, the enemy’s main tools could be detected.[^8] The sound of a pick striking chalk could be heard at a distance of between 80 and 90&nbsp;metres. Listening was so precise that it could even distinguish the rattle of rubble falling to the floor of a gallery being driven—within a radius of roughly 20&nbsp;metres—as well as the footsteps of enemy miners for nearly 25&nbsp;metres, and even voices for about 15&nbsp;metres. Because listening work went on continuously during underground fighting, the men had to know the geophone procedures inside out. Each day, Jim and Lofty handled the device for an hour. To pinpoint a sound, the operator had to move the two receivers back and forth until the noise was equally clear in both ears. Once that was done, he placed a compass between the receivers, which gave the direction of the sound in degrees from magnetic north. With several operators working at once, their readings were then combined by officers on a map of the underground system. From each listening point, a line was drawn along the angle found by the operator. Where two lines crossed, they indicated the source of the sound, allowing the location—and distance—of enemy miners at work to be determined with precision.

For Jim and Lofty, most of the time spent underground would be devoted to digging. It was a far more complex task than it seemed. The tunnellers had to take into account a number of factors, such as the make-up and composition of the ground, as well as the depth and distances involved in driving galleries. Across the sector held by the British Third Army, the subsoil consisted of a hard, very white chalk plateau some fifty metres deep, sometimes outcropping at the surface. The water table, however, reduced the tunnellers’ workable depth to roughly thirty metres. The men had to keep track of the level of the groundwater, which could vary by nearly ten metres depending on the season.[^9] The greatest challenge was directing the work towards a target to be destroyed. Plans of the underground network had to be kept up to date so that everyone could find their bearings and so that the digging could be steered in the right direction. Although gallery dimensions were not yet standardised (they would be from July onward), the instructors recommended mining galleries about 1.30&nbsp;metres high and about 0.70&nbsp;metres wide. These measurements, larger than those used in French tunnels, made it easier to move and work. The trainees practised digging and timbering for an hour and a half each day, even though chalk ground required very little shoring. The school had its own underground network. To drive these galleries, the preferred tool was the pick, but blows struck into the chalk were loud. Jim and Lofty had to admit that they could be heard while digging—just as they would be able to hear the muffled blows of the enemy’s pick.

The school’s main focus was preparing its trainees for underground rescue work. This was the most important part of the instruction and was taught for three hours each day. Some lessons—particularly those on organising first-aid operations—were given in a classroom where benches and tables were set out facing a central dais. The walls were covered with posters illustrating the various rescue equipment. The trainees were first taught how to detect gas in a tunnel. The chalk layer contained no natural gas; only a mine explosion produced different kinds of gas. The most common were methane and hydrogen, but carbon monoxide was by far the most dangerous. It was invisible, odourless, and tasteless. In the maze of underground galleries, such gases could quickly become a deadly trap. Gassed men had to receive appropriate care, including the administration of oxygen for a shorter or longer period. The tunnellers were therefore trained to use the Novita, an oxygen resuscitation apparatus, and to learn the techniques of artificial respiration.[^10] They then followed a course on the Proto and the Salvus, two breathing-protection devices that allowed men to enter, without undue risk, an underground system filled with gas. Both relied on a system that supplied oxygen continuously from compressed-air cylinders.[^11] The Proto was ideal for prolonged use; shorter interventions—under thirty minutes—were carried out with the Salvus. The trainees tested both pieces of equipment, having studied their component parts in detail. Each man had to get used to wearing the unpleasant apparatus and remain calm enough to breathe normally. Jim and Lofty were responsible for their own kit and had to clean it and recharge it with oxygen at the end of each lesson. The two men were introduced to &ldquo;Sapper Dummy&rdquo;, a rather tubby mannequin whose life was always in jeopardy in the different scenarios staged by the instructors. These mock rescue operations took the pair more than twenty-five metres underground, into a gallery thick with smoke. The whole class paid close attention to this course, which carried a direct responsibility for the safety of their comrades below ground.

The mining school programme culminated in a certificate awarded upon successful completion of the assessments. The sappers and NCOs sat a single oral examination based on the rescue lessons covered in class.[^12] Jim and Lofty, who had focused closely on this instruction, passed it successfully. Officers were assessed in the same field, but through a two-hour written paper. In addition, they took a three-hour written test on underground-warfare strategy, taught only to officers, as well as an assessment in first-aid operations in which the other ranks also took part.[^13] For many tunnellers, the school felt like time set apart—its ten days of training passed far too quickly.

On their return to the trenches, Jim and Lofty found their comrades in a dire situation. With the help of French sappers, the tunnellers had pinpointed the enemy near the old Lille road.[^14] The firing of three galleries had even been considered as early as 21&nbsp;March, but only one of them was actually loaded with explosives. Even then, the mine was not fired. No immediate action was taken—no doubt for lack of experience and know-how. George and Gerald, like the rest of their comrades, spent their time clearing out the tunnels and preparing for the next operations. They were also sent on reconnaissance into the French system on the other side of the Lille road. The enemy, for his part, was on familiar ground. On 26&nbsp;March, he detonated a mine at the very spot where the New Zealanders had located him at work just days earlier. The attack was a success for the Germans: as well as damaging the New Zealand network, it caused many casualties. Caught up in the final handover from the French underground units, the tunnellers were unable to counter-attack. The return of the men from the mining school did nothing to change the situation. The Germans had managed to slip between the underground defences and were now close to the British front line.

The mine inspectors, responsible for directing underground military operations on the front, did not wait for the trenches to be destroyed on the surface before taking action. They decided to take the Labyrinth sector away from the New Zealanders. To replace them, they called in the more experienced men of the 185th&nbsp;Tunnelling Company. Formed in October 1915, this unit had fought alongside the 179th&nbsp;Company at La Boisselle, then received orders to strengthen the new positions in Artois, settling in early March 1916 at Chantecler—a sector located one kilometre south of the one held by the New Zealand tunnellers. Between 29&nbsp;March and 2&nbsp;April 1916, the two companies organised the handover of their combat area. Everything necessary was prepared at Chantecler so that the New Zealanders’ work could begin under good conditions. The enemy was quieter there, and the New Zealanders would have the freedom to build up experience gradually. At the Labyrinth, the situation was critical for the 185th&nbsp;Company. The surveys carried out by their counterparts from the Antipodes had to be redone quickly, as the British did not consider them reliable.[^15] The first listening sessions conducted in the former New Zealand galleries revealed that the front line was in danger in several places.[^16] The German miners were no longer under No Man’s Land, but directly beneath the British trenches. Until the underground situation could be made safer, the unit recommended evacuating some troops from various parts of the line.[^17]
