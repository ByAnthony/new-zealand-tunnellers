# Chapter 13: A Spectacular Achievement

With the success of the offensive at the end of August 1918, Lofty, Sharkey, George, and their comrades were following in the footsteps of their infantry compatriots. The Allies advanced cautiously, struggling to abandon the habits of trench warfare. The Germans were being pushed back along the entire front between Arras and Reims, but their lines had not been broken nonetheless. The tunnellers were then working to repair roads and to finish collecting the equipment left behind in the trenches and underground shelters of the Marieux sector. Such tasks were now familiar to them in the aftermath of the major offensives in which they had been engaged. This time, however, their role underground was clearly being set aside in favor of ever more numerous works carried out on the surface.

The chief engineers of the British Army were gradually repurposing the activities of the roughly thirty tunnelling companies present on the Western Front[^1]. In the space of a few weeks, some of them were assigned to fighting alongside the infantry, others were converted into full-fledged engineer troops, and a few even found a singular new role as firefighters. The main mission of the New Zealanders was to restore lines of communication. The front was in fact a vast devastated field, dotted with shell holes and mine craters that now made the landscape uneven and rolling[^2]. Everything on the surface had been destroyed; even vegetation was scarce. Roads were cut and torn up for hundreds of meters. Lofty, Sharkey, George, and the others therefore had to clear what remained of the communication routes of every obstructing obstacle: trees, barbed wire, bricks, and other debris—the disastrous result of several years of intense bombardment, especially near small villages now completely ruined. Trenches and shell holes had to be filled in before traffic could be restored, because the movement of troops forward was essential to the continuation of operations. The work was enormous, and the help provided by the tunnellers was invaluable.

From the end of August, the unit’s new camp was operational at Bucquoy, twenty kilometres south of Arras. Located near a main road, it allowed the men to reach the different work sites more easily and more quickly. Equipped with a canteen and a kitchen, it also had a store, soon supplied with a large stock of French beer[^3]. Accustomed to their daily tea, the men descended on it! With the heatwave of the summer of 1918, some of George’s comrades also worked on installing pumps and water networks, with the help of two British engineer units, the 142nd and 149th&nbsp;Army Troops Companies, to replace the wells destroyed by the Germans during their retreat[^4].

The company’s strength was at its lowest, and no further reinforcements were expected. In Major Vickerman’s absence, while he was away on leave, Captain Campbell had taken command of the company. But, expected at the British Army School of Engineering in Rouen, he too had to hand over command to Captain Holmes, urgently recalled from his advisory work in mechanics with several Army Troops companies of the British Fourth Corps. The intense activity of the past few days was now behind the tunnellers, and everyone enjoyed a brief respite after the first successes against the enemy. Seventy men were on leave, while the others were able to enjoy a few days of rest[^5]. This general pause in the fighting allowed the British Army to rest its troops. The planners also used this time to prepare as well as possible for the continuation of operations. British soldiers were thus in the southern part of the Nord department, crossed by several canals and rivers: the Canal du Nord, still under construction when war was declared and resembling an immense gash across the landscape; the Scheldt Canal; and the rivers Selle and Sambre. The troops’ advance would therefore run up against obstacles to be crossed, all the more so because the British suspected the Germans would destroy their footbridges if they were forced to abandon their positions. Bridges would therefore have to be built for the front-line soldiers, as well as for reinforcements, transport traffic, and ambulances. With many engineer troops already employed on a large number of works, they were not numerous enough to take charge of all the bridge-building to come[^6]. A rumour then began to circulate through the company. In the know, Lofty and Sharkey passed it on to comrades who had not heard it. Quickly, the rumour spread among the other ranks that, if the offensive continued, they would become &ldquo;pontonniers&rdquo;—that is, bridge builders[^7]!

These rumours were not far-fetched. Less than a year earlier, in the midst of the Battle of Cambrai, at the end of November 1917, a group of around fifty tunnellers from Section&nbsp;4, under the command of Lieutenant James Oliver Campbell Neill, had helped the 142nd&nbsp;Army Troops Company to erect a footbridge on the Bapaume–Cambrai road, where it crossed the Canal du Nord[^8]. The only prelude to their conversion into pontonniers, the men had had to face particularly gruelling combat conditions. The launch of the offensive on 20&nbsp;November 1917, supported by 380&nbsp;tanks, had not pushed the enemy line back far enough at the construction site, so that the tunnellers and the sappers of the 142nd&nbsp;Army Troops Company came under intense and violent fire. Fortunately, the spot where the bridge was to be erected was much safer, concealed from the enemy’s view, who did not think to shell the position. But the working conditions were extreme[^9]. A strong, cold wind, accompanied by rain, hampered the men’s task during the day, then at night under a downpour. Yet, in three days, the bridge was finished. Not a single tunneller was wounded. The engineer troops of the Army Troops unit were less fortunate, suffering some killed and several dozen wounded[^10]. On the evening of 26&nbsp;November, as the men were due to return to their camp, the newly opened bridge was shelled and everyone was urgently recalled to repair the damage under torrential rain. At the same time, the Germans had begun to retake the ground they had lost thanks to an influx of reinforcements. Although it was again operational, the bridge was never used, except for the passage of one or two ambulances, as Lieutenant Neill sadly lamented[^11]. The enemy had in fact moved back towards the canal too quickly, and at dawn the bridge had to be destroyed by the very soldiers who had helped to build it. With that trial, the New Zealanders were far from having become pontonniers. All in all, they showed great adaptability in the tasks they were assigned.

At the beginning of September 1918, ten men who knew the rudiments of bridge construction, including Lieutenant Neill, were sent for training at Rosel, in Normandy, a few kilometers northwest of Caen. There, they would broaden and refine their skills in this field. Few additional men could be requisitioned to follow the course, because they were now occupied with their various tasks. Thus, the 142nd&nbsp;Army Troops Company rejoined the tunnellers to carry out water-supply works at Ytres, about five kilometers southwest of Havrincourt, near the Canal du Nord[^12]. George and his comrades of the Section&nbsp;2 assisted them, soon joined by the Section&nbsp;4. Lofty, Sharkey, and the rest of Section&nbsp;1 resumed repairs on the road from Puisieux to Miraumont, which had been abandoned by their colleagues of Section&nbsp;4, while the Section&nbsp;3 divided its efforts between reinforcing fifteen former German underground shelters and building an advanced headquarters at Ligny-Thilloy, south of Bapaume[^13].

However, the seriousness shown by Lieutenant Neill and his group encouraged the sending of more men. Sixteen additional tunnellers were dispatched to the bridge school on 12&nbsp;September. On the same day, three divisions of the British Third Army, including the New Zealand Division, launched an attack on the village of Havrincourt, about twenty kilometers east of Bapaume[^14]. Despite their superiority, the Germans were unable to hold their position. By the end of the day, the village was in British hands. Building on this success, the Fourth Army planned to seize ground in the direction of Épehy, about ten kilometers south of Havrincourt.

Another team, made up of Lieutenant McKee and 29&nbsp;NCOs and other ranks, left for Normandy. On 16&nbsp;September, Lieutenant Leeds in turn joined the benches of the bridge school, followed a few days later by 11&nbsp;other tunnellers. In total, 68&nbsp;members of the company received bridge-construction training. Lofty and George, like more than 80% of the men, had not been selected. The former was working with his comrades on repairing a road between Hébuterne and Bucquoy. The latter was still at Ytres with the 142nd&nbsp;Army Troops Company. As all of this work was coming to an end, on 23&nbsp;September the IVth British Army Corps ordered the company to be ready to build its first bridge, 55&nbsp;meters long, over the Canal du Nord, between the villages of Hermies and Havrincourt, southwest of Cambrai[^15].

The battles of Havrincourt and Épehy in mid-September had pushed the enemy back behind the Canal du Nord. The front line now ran along this immense, waterless trench on its western side from its junction with the Sensée River to near Demicourt, where it shifted to the east of the canal and of the village of Havrincourt, heading toward Épehy and Saint-Quentin. The opening up of the Canal du Nord south of Demicourt made it possible to approve the construction, in that area, of a bridge directly linked to the offensive against the Hindenburg Line planned for the end of the month.

On the morning of 25&nbsp;September, the entire company assembled at Bapaume station to receive the first shipment of materials intended for the bridge and load it onto lorries. George, who had just arrived with his team, adjusted his hat to shield himself from the rain, a meagre defence against the wretched weather. A cheerful crowd had formed, surrounding two men who were gesticulating and speaking loudly. Curious, George went over and discovered two of his comrades from another section explaining, with no small amount of humour, why they, inexperienced tunnellers, had been chosen to build a footbridge over a canal. One mimed the act of digging a tunnel, while the other, watching him stoically, told him to rethink his bridge-building technique! The first, pretending not to understand the remark, stupidly asked whether he would need his pickaxe for his new assignment! Around them, the men laughed. The NCOs let them carry on, since they shared the same questions and fears about a task for which they were no better prepared[^16]. The officers had no more answers as to the unusual choice of having a bridge erected by the men of their unit. The improvised skit did not last, and the men were formed up before unloading began. In two days, more than three tonnes of materials were prepared and loaded onto 24&nbsp;lorries. The convoy was organised according to the order of construction, saving time on the building of the structure. More were to follow as new consignments arrived at the station. In the meantime, 40&nbsp;tunnellers stayed behind to organise the next convoys[^17].

On the morning of 27&nbsp;September, the British First and Third Armies launched their assault on the German lines near the Canal du Nord, giving the signal for the New Zealanders to move to the construction site. Along the still-unfinished canal, bitter fighting was under way, slowing the convoy’s progress; several times it came under enemy fire[^18]. Barely some twenty kilometres from Bapaume, the village of Hermies was not reached until the evening, too late to make use of the last daylight and begin operations. Luck was nevertheless on the tunnellers’ side: no one was wounded, and no lorry carrying the precious cargo was damaged. At dawn the next day, Lofty began unloading with more than 150 of his comrades. Slowly, the first steel beams were laid on the ground. Most of the equipment consisted of light, pre-assembled components. It was intended to build a &ldquo;Hopkins&rdquo; footbridge, named after its designer, Captain Hopkins of the British Royal Engineers, who had come in person to advise the unit’s officers on the choice of construction site. Though sheltered from the enemy’s view, the location was not the easiest place to put up a bridge. Driven by curiosity, Lofty had timidly approached the bank where, below him, he could see the canal under construction. He could not help letting out a whistle of admiration. From where he stood, the tunneller could make out the eastern bank, more than 30&nbsp;metres high, faced with red brick and rising in four tiers, made up of a series of pierced, flattened arches, which reinforced the cutting driven through the hill. The western side seemed to have been built in the same way, though Lofty only cast a quick glance over the edge of the precipice. Beyond the height, the distance separating the two banks caught his attention—and for good reason: at this point it was simply the widest span of the canal, measuring 55&nbsp;metres.

One of the constraints was to build a bridge capable of spanning that distance, since the Hopkins footbridge had a standard length of only 40&nbsp;metres. The tunnellers would therefore have to join two bridges together, using the identical components that were freely interchangeable between the two structures. The other constraint was to work with equipment designed to lift and haul the 30&nbsp;tonnes of the footbridge’s original weight. The cables and winches would be subjected to greater strain, as the bridge’s length and weight would be doubled. The tunnellers were thus embarking on the erection of a true prototype and had to prove equal to their opponents, who had already built a wooden bridge on the same site. The plan called for assembling the metal framework on rollers on the west bank, while a wooden hauling system was to be set up on the east bank.

Lofty and Sharkey had been assigned to the morning team, made up solely of men from their company, numbering 155, while George had been placed in the afternoon team, which combined 115&nbsp;tunnellers and 56&nbsp;soldiers of all ranks from the 565th and 577th&nbsp;Army Troops Companies, brought in to bolster the New Zealand unit and, above all, to contribute their experience[^19]. Their comrades who had remained in Bapaume were working to organise the dispatch of equipment to the construction site. However, the offensive threw the sector into turmoil: roads clogged with troop transports, food and ammunition convoys, and the passage of ambulances held up the 20&nbsp;trucks that set out on 28&nbsp;September. The next day, another convoy of the same size made its way toward Hermies with equal difficulty. The metallic tangle took shape fairly quickly as installations and bolting carried out in the morning were continued in the afternoon. To build the sides of the bridge, connecting beams were first fixed to a horizontal metal girder. Then, with the help of winches and cables, the tunnellers raised them into position, forming a triangular framework. Each side was thus made up of 32&nbsp;diagonal connecting beams which, once installed, formed a continuous row of 16 triangular units. The two sides were then linked by beams at their top and base, as well as by temporary cross-bracing that would give the skeleton greater stability during its placement over the canal. In three days, the structure—73&nbsp;metres in total length—was ready for the major manoeuvre. On the east bank, the hauling system—made up of two massive wooden beams solidly anchored to the ground and held by cables—had been assembled. The winches were installed and could support a total load of 70&nbsp;tonnes[^20]. A 60&nbsp;tonne counterweight was placed at the end of the bridge, supplemented as a safety measure by an additional 20&nbsp;tonnes, to better counterbalance the section that would be hanging in mid-air during the hauling operation[^21]. After a final inspection of the wooden towers, the officers asked their men to replace the upper chocks that kept the two huge beams aligned on the same axis, judging them insufficiently strong in view of the weight of the metal framework. George and the rest of his companions were so preoccupied with the preparations that they did not notice the visit—both unexpected and prestigious—of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies, Field Marshal Douglas Haig[^22]. The most perilous part of the operation was, in fact, about to begin.

At precisely 5&nbsp;p.m., George was in position in the line of men formed behind the left tower. At his feet, he and his comrades took hold of the cable which, through a system of pulleys and winches, was connected to the end of the bridge on the other side of the canal. The other line, posted beside them behind the right tower, did the same. Moving as one, the tunnellers pulled gently; the two steel cables tightened. On the west bank, the other part of the team had taken up position behind the bridge to prevent, using a system of winches and cables, the structure from sliding down into the canal. Just as the bridge was about to be hauled forward, the officers immediately gave the order to stop the manoeuvre. They had noticed that one of the towers was showing signs of weakness. Poorly anchored to the ground, the massive beam had to be modified, pushing the start of the operation back to the next morning.

Arriving on site at 6&nbsp;a.m., Lofty and Sharkey were assigned to the rear of the bridge. The manoeuvre was repeated and, with no apparent problem, the bridge moved forward centimetre by centimetre[^23]. With part of the team, Lofty and Sharkey eased off one of the cables that held the rear of the structure as it advanced over the precipice. Five metres of the bridge were now projecting into empty space. The operation seemed to be proceeding without incident. Ten metres were now suspended. One of the cables pulling the bridge snapped, worn through too quickly by a winch that was too flimsy. The bridge was set down on blocks and the faulty winch was replaced[^24]. Then the manoeuvre resumed slowly. The metal skeleton advanced with great caution. In the afternoon, the second team took over. Lofty and Sharkey were exhausted, like many of their comrades. Nerves had been severely tested. Fresh and fully fit, the men of the afternoon team continued with the utmost vigilance. Twenty metres of the structure were now floating above the canal. Additional rollers were added as a safety measure. George and his comrades were again visited by Field Marshal Haig, accompanied by an American trade unionist and leader of the American Federation of Labor, a member of the National Defense Council, Samuel Gompers[^25]. The two men arrived at a crucial moment. Half of the bridge was hanging in mid-air and, as a precaution, all the equipment needed for the manoeuvre was replaced. The metal skeleton was therefore secured on blocks and stabilised for the night.

On 3&nbsp;October, from 6&nbsp;a.m., operations resumed. The tunnellers had to keep their nerve in the face of how slowly the work progressed. Because of its weight, the part of the framework hanging in mid-air tilted forward. As a result, when it reached the opposite bank of the canal, it was more than 3.5&nbsp;metres below the level of the bank[^26]. The towers had only been used to pull the bridge, not to lift it. The hardest part of the operation was therefore only just beginning because, at the slightest mistake, the structure could fall to the bottom of the ravine. The two winches were set in motion and slowly raised the front of the bridge. Centimetre by centimetre, it drew closer to the correct height of the bank. The manoeuvre was extremely delicate. It had to be carried out calmly and gently. Suddenly, the right-hand winch jammed. The framework was still two metres below the level of the bank. Fortunately for the tunnellers, the bridge was close enough to their side to install a platform and set the bridge down on jacks. With it braced in place, the men repaired the winch which, once operational, was able to hoist the structure. Around 6&nbsp;p.m., the bridge was lifted a few centimetres above the ground. It was pulled one last time and, at 7&nbsp;p.m., it was set down carefully on the eastern side. After three days of manoeuvring, the two banks were linked.

The company had just achieved a remarkable engineering feat. Congratulations poured in, first from Field Marshal Haig who, in a note addressed to the unit’s commanding officer, praised their excellent work, both present and past[^27]. The message from the Chief Engineer of the Third Army, Brigadier General Little, was just as warm, lauding the brilliant achievement[^28]. The Chief Engineer of the Fourth Corps, Brigadier General Harvey, for his part, complimented the sound execution of the mission[^29]. The commander of the Third Army, General Byng, even paid the honour of a visit to the bridge on the afternoon of 4&nbsp;October. And for good reason: the structure was exceptional. It was quite simply the longest bridge ever built during the war. With 104&nbsp;hours of work, it was also the longest in terms of time taken to complete. The New Zealanders had shown exemplary professionalism in rising to this challenge, even though most of them knew nothing about bridge-building.

Lofty, Sharkey, George and the rest of the men had been brought together to finish their mission as quickly as possible. It was a real anthill of activity around the bridge. The temporary steel cross-bracing, meant to stabilise the structure during its placement, was removed, as was the counterweight at the end of the bridge. Nearly twenty metres of the framework, which had provided better balance during the manoeuvre, were dismantled[^30]. All day on 5&nbsp;October, the tunnellers completed the work by laying the decking and fitting the guardrails. A small footway was also installed along one side of the bridge[^31]. As Lofty, Sharkey, George and their comrades brought the job to a close, the official photographer of the Fourth Corps captured the final stages. He also asked the tunnellers to pose on the spectacular structure. While Lofty and George leaned along the handrail of the footway, other, more daring men—like Sharkey—climbed the framework to sit on the upper beams. The bridge was opened to traffic shortly after 17&nbsp;hours[^32].

The next day, all the equipment that had been used to assemble and position the bridge was packed away and sent back by lorry to Bapaume. On 7&nbsp;October, George and more than fifty other men remained on site to begin camouflaging the structure, while Lofty and Sharkey’s company enjoyed a period of rest and baths at Royaulcourt, a village a few kilometres south-west of Havrincourt. From the following morning, additional tunnellers arrived to reinforce George’s group. As a safety measure, they built, on each side, a pier braced against the bank to support and strengthen the first metres of the bridge[^33]. This was intended to relieve the central section, which bore the greatest load and had a tendency to sag. The bridge built by the New Zealand company, which had not been designed to reach such a great length, therefore represented a risk in use. The span over open space was thus reduced from 55 to 36&nbsp;metres. Above all, the bridge had to remain in place, since no other bridge allowed heavy transports to cross between the two sides of the canal under construction. The other footbridges had been built temporarily for the offensive and were mainly intended for troops on foot. Camouflage painting continued at Havrincourt while two sections, including Lofty and Sharkey’s, left for Noyelles-sur-Escaut to build a new bridge.
