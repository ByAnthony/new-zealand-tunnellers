# Chapter 10: Still Digging

In one of the former British trenches, near the Cambrai road, Gerald’s team was searching for all kinds of reusable materials, the most valuable of which was timber. They had no trouble finding any. The parapet showed a line of logs holding wooden planks in place[^1]. Accompanied by about ten comrades, the sapper also explored old underground shelters, though they remained cautious, as a few armed explosive charges had already been discovered beneath a German trench along the Scarpe.

Standard planks shipped from Great Britain or Norway had not been delivered for several months. At first, they were replaced by rough pine boards cut in France, but the tunnellers showed initiative by reusing material that was now unnecessary. A large quantity of timber was required to fit out the various works, including machine-gun nests and trench-mortar battery positions, a few observation posts, as well as underground shelters used as billets, a medical post, an ammunition store, or even headquarters. Part of the timber was used to shore up the roof of the access descents and the underground chamber. The rest was used to line ceilings and walls, which were never left bare. An underground billet of about 20&nbsp;square metres, for example, required more than 400&nbsp;linear metres of boards with an average width of 20&nbsp;centimetres. Wood collection therefore went on continuously to supply the different projects at the front.

Once recovered, the timber was carried to the tunnellers’ workshop, set up right next to their camp, which was transferred at the end of June 1917 from Agnez-lès-Duisans to Arras, and located in several houses on either side of the rue de l’Égalité and at numbers 45 and 47 on the rue de Lille[^2]. The New Zealanders received hand and powered drills, circular saws, and other supplies from the men of the 184th&nbsp;Tunnelling Company, who were leaving the sector for the Belgian coast. They set up a sawmill to prepare the timber and make the job easier for their colleagues in the trenches. The railway line running from Arras station, repaired at the end of July, made it possible to ship the materials directly to the front, sparing the fatigue of road transport via the Cambrai road. As the sawmill quickly became too small, a new one was built near Arras station, in the Ronville district, in September[^3]. Stacked along the railway tracks, the wooden planks formed a fairly substantial stock that allowed the tunnellers to work with ease. They were cut down to the dimensions in use. Unloaded at the front, the material was then sent out to the different sections depending on the various tasks underway.

To make the work easier, the four sections divided up the operational area. From July onwards, the Section&nbsp;1 had exclusive responsibility for work north of the Scarpe. The Section&nbsp;3 operated between the Scarpe and Monchy-le-Preux. The Section&nbsp;2 and 4 worked east of that village: the Section&nbsp;2 was on the front line, while the 4th was in the cover and reserve trenches. Each section worked almost independently of the others. It received its orders from the unit headquarters, which specified the structures to be built and thereby determined how the work parties were formed. As in underground warfare, the men dug continuously, day and night. The same ritual was repeated for every underground shelter: digging, installing the timbering, and fitting out the interior. The watchwords were speed, vigilance, and safety. The company did not slacken. As well as fortifying the front line, these works provided greater comfort for soldiers on a completely devastated battlefield, where no building had withstood the fighting.

The subsoil showed virtually no difference from what the tunnellers had been digging through since their arrival. Dominated by the white chalk plateau, its composition had the advantage of providing natural protection, which meant the shelters did not need to be buried too deeply, generally between 6 and 8&nbsp;metres underground. The tunnellers nevertheless noted a particular feature of the ground in the area worked by the 2nd and 4th&nbsp;sections, around Monchy-le-Preux. The chalk plateau is distorted there by a rise made up of a distinctive layer that is also found in the 1st&nbsp;section’s sector, north of the Scarpe[^4]. The chalk is in fact cut through by a fairly substantial layer of impermeable plastic clay, greyish or greenish-grey in colour, which can even reach several metres in thickness. This layer is capped by a small pocket of sand, much more extensive in the 1st&nbsp;section’s sector, forming two rises: one to the south-east of the village of Rœux and the other to the south of the village of Gavrelle. Digging in sand is not impossible, but the work becomes very difficult and rather uncertain, partly because of its composition. In dry weather, the sand is soft and too easy to remove. In wet weather, it turns into real mud—too fluid—held at the base by the impermeable clay layer. The works would quickly flood in the event of heavy rain. The tunnellers avoided installing underground shelters in these areas. The clay provided a better substrate, but it was scarcely excavated around Monchy-le-Preux. The men preferred the white chalk to the north and south of the village. North of the Scarpe, the situation was different. Clay and chalk shared the area, so works were laid out in both layers. The officers were responsible for selecting locations likely to accommodate underground shelters[^5]. After an initial selection of sites, the ground was probed to determine its exact nature.

At the beginning of the summer of 1917, around twenty works had already been started. In the lines in front of Monchy-le-Preux, Gerald’s team was busy inside a machine-gun nest, a small camouflaged, half-buried shelter designed to hold a maximum of three soldiers as well as a machine gun and their equipment. The officers quickly standardised the dimensions to make the work easier. Two types of nests were therefore designed[^6]. The first, rectangular in shape, was built entirely out of wood. The second, circular, was made with a framework of iron plates. These nests should not be confused with machine-gun emplacements, which were merely surface modifications within the trenches[^7]. As its name suggests, the nest was a fortified position outside the lines. Access was via a tunnel directly from the trench or from an underground shelter, which was then used as quarters for the machine-gunners.

The same layout was developed for mortar-battery emplacements. Here too, the shelter served as living quarters or as a store. The firing platform was about 5&nbsp;metres underground, opening to the surface through a kind of slanted shaft with a pentagonal shape[^8]. The mortar then made it possible to destroy positions hidden behind a fortified parapet that formed a trench’s primary defence. The angle of the opening varied between 40 and 75&nbsp;degrees, allowing mortar fire at an elevation of between 45 and 70&nbsp;degrees. Like the machine-gun nest, a mortar-battery emplacement was a basic element of positional warfare. Set along the front, these underground emplacements of identical dimensions were located in fortified sectors of the line.

North of the Scarpe, Lofty and Sharkey had begun digging an underground shelter to house the billeting of 24&nbsp;soldiers beneath a trench near Rœux. Suffering more and more from his back, Jim had been assigned to supply duties, which allowed him to visit his comrades[^9]. In the access stairway, the Fatigues formed a human chain to bring up the sacks of spoil. The access was already finished, well shored up, and even the small protective recess had been fitted out at the bottom of the descent. It was meant to stop any small spherical mines that the enemy sometimes managed to roll down the steps during raids, preventing them from reaching the shelter itself. Jim was exhausted. Lofty could only note his condition with dismay. The bandages compressing his back had torn. The sapper felt pain up into his neck. Fortunately, his leave across the Channel was due in a few days[^10].

The apparent calm on the front, which allowed the tunnellers to begin 43&nbsp;new underground works, came to an end in the last days of July. The Germans heavily bombarded the trenches in front of Monchy-le-Preux and attempted a few attacks without success[^11]. Caught under the shells, Gerald and his comrades took shelter in the underground work they were digging. On 2&nbsp;August, at 11&nbsp;p.m., German soldiers managed to break into the British lines, but were quickly driven out[^12]. Work in this sector had to be temporarily halted while the fighting lasted. Fortunately, little damage was done to the works in progress and to the existing structures. The Germans continued their bombardment, to which the British replied by opening fire and then going over to the attack on the night of 9–10&nbsp;August. The New Zealanders were kept out of the operations and only learned the next morning that they had been successful, except in a small stretch of the front around the Scarpe[^13]. The trenches regained a certain calm. The tunnellers began 37&nbsp;new works in August, and were then working on nearly 70&nbsp;underground projects at the same time. About 500 tunnellers were serving in the company. The peak was reached during the week of 5–12&nbsp;September with 19&nbsp;officers and 564&nbsp;other ranks. The trenches at Monchy-le-Preux, the main focus of the attacks, were hardly occupied by the New Zealanders anymore. The only work carried out forward in September was the extension of a billeting shelter. After that, only five mortar-battery positions, three of them associated with an underground shelter, were dug near the front line. Bombardments gave way to raids. The British carried out a successful incursion into the enemy trenches on 22&nbsp;September, while the tunnellers had struck a spring while digging a shelter[^14]. The Germans counter-attacked the next day, probably humiliated at having been pushed back under British pressure and eager to recover their ground. They attempted two raids during the day on 23&nbsp;September, both of which were repulsed immediately. Taking advantage of their success, the British troops organised another attack. On 14&nbsp;October, the German trenches were subjected to very heavy bombardment. At 4:55&nbsp;p.m., the British launched an assault on the lines east of Monchy-le-Preux. The raid was a complete success. They captured three machine guns and took 64 prisoners[^15]. That same evening, at 9:30&nbsp;p.m., another attack succeeded in breaking the enemy defences at Rœux, north of the Scarpe.

Across the whole New Zealand sector, the work carried out beneath the trenches was progressing at a monthly pace identical to that of August. After many months away, George returned to the unit. He had recovered quickly from his sprain, but a serious incident when he was about to leave again for France, with no further detail in his medical file, had sent him back to hospital for many months. His companion Gerald no longer seemed like the same man. He spoke only of his desire to be transferred to the infantry. From 8&nbsp;November, the unit worked with only three sections. The Section&nbsp;4 left Arras for the village of Metz-en-Couture, in the Somme department[^16]. Their mission did not differ from that of the rest of the company. They were still digging underground shelters, in preparation for a British offensive planned for the end of November, south-west of Cambrai[^17]. Despite the absence of a full section, the overall strength did not fall thanks to the arrival of new reinforcements on 9&nbsp;November. The work was nonetheless disrupted by actions carried out on both sides of No Man’s Land. In response to British bombardments, the Germans used poison gas on 17&nbsp;November. Five tunnellers were gassed and evacuated. The British, however, kept up the pressure on their opponent. Their attacks grew increasingly violent and a deluge of bombs fell on the German lines, which immediately replied. On 20&nbsp;November, a German offensive was launched north of the Scarpe. The men of Section&nbsp;1, who had hardly been working in that sector anymore, returned to repair the entrances to many underground shelters that had collapsed during the bombardments[^18]. Another consequence of the fighting was a drop in the number of Fatigues, most of whom were recalled to their infantry units. If only the Section&nbsp;3 experienced disruption at first, the whole company soon suffered from this lack of manpower. Digging also shifted further away from the front. George’s and Lofty’s teams began their works along the Arras–Douai railway line, south of Fampoux, and across the plain of Arras, west of Monchy-le-Preux. Gerald obtained his long-awaited transfer and said goodbye to George. With orders in hand, he joined the ranks of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of the Auckland Regiment on 21&nbsp;November 1917, at Ypres.

In turn, the tunnellers were assigned to collect unexploded shells, both German and British. This task broke up the monotonous routine of work beneath the trenches from the end of July 1917. The bombs, damaged or unsafe, gathered south of the Scarpe were taken to a secure site outside the village of Wanquetin, about ten kilometres west of Arras. There, the tunnellers also set to work digging galleries to store the munitions before detonating them[^19]. The shells found north of the Scarpe were, for their part, transported to an old New Zealand tunnel network, dug during the underground war, south of Roclincourt. Apart from installing new supports at the entrance and cleaning the tunnel, the men only had to deposit the ammunition. During the first weeks of August, preparations continued at both sites.

At Roclincourt, shells and bombs were stacked carefully to a height of 90&nbsp;centimetres and along a length of 1.5&nbsp;metres. Between each stack, an explosive charge of about 90 kilograms was placed, with its electric firing system. This lengthy operation was completed in early September. The accumulation extended for a total length of 64&nbsp;metres[^20]. On 12&nbsp;September, in the early afternoon, the tunnellers ran the electrical cables from the gallery to the firing point, several hundred metres away. The entrance to the network was filled in with several metres of sandbags. The electrical wires were connected to the detonator. The men now waited only for the order to set it off. That order was given at precisely 3&nbsp;p.m.[^21] A heavy, muffled explosion rang out, then the ground heaved and tore itself apart in the air. An immense cloud, a mixture of smoke and dust, engulfed the blast site. After several tens of minutes, the smoke cleared, revealing a devastated, almost apocalyptic landscape. A crater more than 10&nbsp;metres deep had formed, nearly 1,000&nbsp;metres in diameter. The operation was a success.

At Wanquetin, digging the underground system took longer than expected because of the shortage of Fatigues and because priority was given to building a road for transporting the munitions[^22]. The tunnels were not ready to receive the damaged bombs and shells until the beginning of October. As at Roclincourt, stacks were made, separated by explosive charges. The task took almost a month, and the date of the blast was set for 5&nbsp;November, at 3&nbsp;p.m. On the day, the mine only partially detonated, destroying only the entrance to the small underground system[^23]. Perplexed, the New Zealanders dug a shaft to reach the main gallery. They wanted to examine the charges and test the electrical cables. After several days of work, an access point was made more than 10 metres below the surface. All detonators and cables were tested in an attempt to find the fault in the firing system. Finally, since nothing seemed abnormal, the tunnellers decided to replace the electrical wires[^24]. All the cables were removed carefully. The charges were disarmed and made completely safe. The new wires were installed and tested to ensure they worked properly. The men then prepared the firing again. The access shaft was backfilled. The date of the explosion was set for 5&nbsp;December, at 3&nbsp;p.m., exactly one month after the previous attempt. As they had become accustomed to doing, the tunnellers set up the cables and detonator in the early afternoon. The site was evacuated. At H-hour, the firing went off without any problem. The earth heaved and hurled metres of earth and chalk debris into the air. A column of smoke rose gradually and covered the entire blast site. The crater was gigantic: nearly 12&nbsp;metres deep over an area of almost 2,300&nbsp;square metres. In these operations, the tunnellers rediscovered their original role in underground warfare. Being an underground fighter did not only mean having a solid knowledge of the terrain and its subsoil in order to dig safely; it also meant understanding the effects of explosives, knowing how to handle them, and how to make them safe.

Reusing underground workings from earlier periods was another aspect of the tunnellers’ work. At the start of their shift in activity, after the beginning of the Battle of Arras, the New Zealanders had already converted a few isolated quarry cavities into billets. Such underground spaces were uncovered from time to time along the front. On 19&nbsp;August 1917, the men of Section&nbsp;1 were digging the entrances to a future billet when they came upon a small quarry[^25]. It was the first of six cavities discovered north of Rœux. Drawing on the experience of connecting the Arras quarries, the officers decided to create a new underground network—much smaller than the one in the capital of Artois and with no offensive purpose.

Each cavity was given the name of a country in the Asian part of the British Empire, with the exception of Corona and Mont Plaisant, which simply took the name of the surrounding hill. The network thus extended from Mont Plaisant toward the India quarry, the largest one, then to a series of four cavities grouped under the name Ceylon, but distinguished by the four cardinal points. North Ceylon opened onto the Malaya quarry, while South Ceylon led into an axis running to Burma and Corona. The names were not chosen at random. A surface trench already bore the name Ceylon. The tunnellers extended the theme with the names of Britain’s other colonies in Asia. From 24&nbsp;August onward, the Ceylon and Corona quarries were occupied and work began. Timber supports were set in the most fragile spots. Mont Plaisant, discovered after Ceylon and Corona, was opened up to the surface. The men carried out the same operation for every new cavity brought to light: digging access points and shoring them up. They were, in effect, playing at being cavers as they explored the subsoil of Rœux[^26]. A quarry was located on 12&nbsp;September, perhaps India. These excavations lay between 9 and 12&nbsp;metres below the surface. The ceilings were not very high, topping out between 2 and 4&nbsp;metres. Once opened, timbered, and cleared, the quarries were connected[^27]. The digging of connecting galleries began between the two smallest, Burma and Corona, in the south-east of the system. Ceylon was then linked to India and to Malaya. The cavities lay close to the front, forming a kind of forward bunker. A first machine-gun nest was dug from the northern end of Malaya. A second was made a few metres from the first. Finally, India was linked to Mont Plaisant on 7&nbsp;November, marking the end of the digging work. Before handing the network over to the troops holding the sector, the sappers of Section&nbsp;1 cleaned it and levelled the floors. Although the surface access points created almost natural ventilation, they installed a ventilation and smoke-extraction system to ensure better safety in case the enemy used lethal gas. As well as billeting troops underground, the network formed a protected passage almost 600&nbsp;metres long between the Cordite reserve trench and the Corona support trench. The soldiers attached great importance to this connection. More than the underground system itself, the area stretching from Rœux to the Scarpe was a very difficult sector. The hard fighting of April and May 1917 had left its marks. The position, won at the cost of many sacrifices, had become a kind of symbol—one that must not be allowed to fall back into German hands.

At the beginning of 1918, the work continued relentlessly. With the return of Section&nbsp;4 to Arras, several dozen new works were started. However, the tunnellers were unable to finish them. A shortage of timber delayed the interior fittings to such an extent that a detachment of 93&nbsp;men from Section&nbsp;3 left for Montauban-de-Picardie and Ransart, in the Somme department, with orders to dismantle wood from old German shelters and bring it back[^28]. Meanwhile, the rest of the unit carried on with its task. A gallery under excavation, intended to allow the construction of a machine-gun nest at Monchy-le-Preux, was abandoned. Cut into sand, it was constantly flooded. The use of water pumps made no difference. Another group from Section&nbsp;3 returned, for the first time since May 1917, to the Arras quarries. The renewed interest in the system was not accidental. Russia’s capitulation on 15&nbsp;December 1917 had in fact brought the war in the East to an end, enabling the transfer of German troops to the West[^29]. Fear of a German attack pushed the British army to prepare once again the vast network beneath the city to house its soldiers, should a withdrawal from the front lines become necessary. The galleries and quarries were therefore cleaned and secured again. They tied up more than fifty sappers—just as many men who no longer dug on the front[^30]. More than any other kind of work, machine-gun nests occupied the men throughout February 1918. Their number had kept increasing since the end of 1917, reaching about a dozen constructions in January and February 1918. This was further proof that fortifying positions implied the possibility of a German offensive. The Entente powers had no doubt about it, but their intelligence services had not been able to determine with certainty in which sector it would be launched[^31]. The work nevertheless proceeded at a slower pace. Lofty’s and George’s teams now worked without their Fatigues, who had been recalled for a series of attacks on the German lines. Some underground billets, barely begun, were cancelled for lack of manpower, and the tunnellers were reassigned to more urgent works. The use of gas shells finally brought all work to a halt in early March.

Weariness seemed to be taking hold of the tunnellers, who had been digging and fitting out the same kinds of works for months. Their officers introduced, for the first time, a few leisure activities, including sports. Organised irregularly, these events were attended with dedication—and not only by the other ranks[^32]. More than two years after leaving their trade and their homes, for the oldest among them, such as Lofty and George, these moments of recreation allowed them to escape, for a while, from their condition as soldiers. While, on the other side of no man’s land, thousands of men were gathering in the greatest secrecy, the men of the British 4th&nbsp;Division organised a rugby tournament in which the New Zealanders took part. The company’s team seemed to have nothing to envy the much-celebrated &ldquo;national&rdquo; team back home. In the tradition of the triumphant All Blacks tour of Europe in 1905, the tunneller-rugby players suffered no defeat in most of their matches, across all competitions. They managed to reach the final of the 4th&nbsp;Division tournament, where they faced a team of players from the artillery. The match took place on 6&nbsp;March 1918 on a ground laid out in the Ronville suburb of Arras. The New Zealanders counted among their ranks the drivers Earlly and McDouglas; the sappers Campbell, O’Callaghan, McNeil, Lowe, Theed, Pilkington, Coedicke, Taylor and Hodge; corporals Schmidt and Wells; Sergeant Wheeler; and Captain Ronayne. Around the field, the rest of the unit took real pleasure in supporting its team as keen, knowledgeable spectators. The tunnellers won the final. A cup rewarded their victory, and a medal was awarded to each player[^33]. The success did not stop there for this team, which also won the tunnelling companies’ rugby league in the same year[^34].

In mid-March, the 1st and 3rd&nbsp;sections swapped their work, for no apparent reason. The men of Section&nbsp;1 continued the clearing work in the Saint-Sauveur network, while those of the Section&nbsp;3 returned to the front. The Section&nbsp;2 withdrew into the city centre of Arras on the orders of the infantry troops who were preparing an assault east of Monchy-le-Preux. Three days later, with no real success from the operations on the surface, it moved back into its forward quarters. Work along the front was still being carried out intermittently, while the British trenches were subjected to intense bombardment. On 21&nbsp;March, the Section&nbsp;2 joined the Section&nbsp;1 in the caverns of the Saint-Sauveur network. The next day, the 3rd and 4th&nbsp;sections hurriedly left the trenches for the Dunedin quarry, in the Ronville system. The Germans had just launched a major offensive along the entire Western Front between the Scarpe and the Oise. The lack of soldiers on the British side and the inability to establish a defence benefited the Germans, who pushed through the Arras plain.
