# Epilogue

&ldquo;Jim Williamson?!&rdquo; At the sound of his name, the white-haired man turned slowly, though his bad back had been troubling him less of late. On the left side of his worn jacket he wore a small dark-blue rectangular ribbon with five coloured central stripes, alternating white and red. Expert eyes would immediately recognise the ribbon bar of the Military Medal, awarded for an act of bravery on the battlefield. The crumpled white paper of an invitation card, hastily stuffed away, was sticking out of one of his pockets. The old soldier, still powerfully built though he had passed his seventieth year, broke into a smile beneath his ever-present moustache as he saw who had called him. Despite the years, he instantly recognised his old comrade Sharkey. The two men fell into each other’s arms. They had not seen one another since the end of the Great War. The reunion, held in Auckland on 7&nbsp;August 1948, brought together, for the first time since its disbandment thirty years earlier, the surviving members of the former tunnelling company.[^1]

During the interwar years, the company’s last commanding officer, Hugh Vickerman, had tried to keep alive the New Zealand branch of the association of former tunnellers founded in Britain in 1926, but he never succeeded in bringing together more than two or three men at a time.[^2] Tracking down the roughly a thousand men scattered across the Dominion and sometimes abroad was an almost impossible task. Vickerman’s role quickly shrank to merely sending messages of goodwill to the organisation’s annual dinners held in London.[^3] Tired of these failures, the former commanding officer gave up his post as representative in 1934, leaving it vacant for several years. Some men therefore never even knew the association existed; others simply had no desire to take part. After being transferred to the Auckland Regiment during the war, Gerald thus broke off all contact with the men of his team, especially George, with whom he had enlisted. Although he had requested the change of posting, the tunneller never grew used to his transfer into the infantry. A month later, in late December 1917, he was returned to the Engineers, thanks to his skills, serving in the 4th Field Company. After the war, Gerald never renewed contact with George and did not go back to Waihi, leaving the mining town for Pukehuia, in the hills of the Northland region, on the banks of the Wairoa River, some 160&nbsp;kilometres north of Auckland.

To revive the New Zealand branch of the tunnellers’ association, the secretary-general of the parent organisation in London offered the leadership of the branch, in 1939, to former Captain John Holmes, who declined because of his poor health. Holmes nevertheless recommended another veteran, James Oliver Campbell Neill, who had published a history of their unit in 1922[^4] and was the only New Zealand tunneller ever to have attended one of the association’s dinners in London, in 1934. Aware of the difficulties, Neill did not try to run a local branch but instead decided to arrange a simple gathering to coincide with the centenary of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi[^5] in Wellington, on 6&nbsp;February 1940. However, the outbreak of war in early September 1939 brought the project to a halt. Beyond its impact in New Zealand, the conflict effectively ended the association’s activities. Neill did not abandon his idea of a reunion, but waited for more favourable times in which to make it happen. By the time he finally set preparations in motion at the end of 1947, many of the former tunnellers had died.

George died on 13&nbsp;March 1939, at the age of fifty-seven, in Gisborne, a coastal town in the north-east of the North Island, in Poverty Bay, where he had settled a few years earlier to join his brother.[^6] His body was buried in Taruheru Cemetery, which stretches along Nelson Road to the north-west of the town. His wife, Lucy, who died on 17&nbsp;December 1970 at the age of seventy-eight, is also buried there, though not in the same grave as her husband, unlike George’s brother John Joseph (1880–1942) and his wife, Lucy Emily (1888–1978).

Gerald died on 3&nbsp;July 1946, at the age of fifty-eight, in Taumarunui, a small town in the King Country region, in the centre of the North Island, west of Lake Taupō.[^7] His body was laid to rest in the section reserved for veterans in the town cemetery, now renamed the Old Cemetery.

Gathered over a glass of beer, Jim and Sharkey did not try to make up for all the years that had passed since they had last seen one another. After exchanging a few bits of news, the conversation naturally turned to their experiences at Arras and in the trenches. Jim asked his old companion if he remembered an English captain who had come to inspect their gallery one evening and had found them making a deafening racket. When it seemed that the episode had slipped Sharkey’s mind, he added that the officer had said to them in a disdainful tone, &ldquo;Do you realise the Boche are probably hearing the din you’re making?&rdquo;[^8] Nodding, Sharkey then recalled that Lofty had shot back without even looking at him, &ldquo;Well, old man, they must be stone deaf if they can’t!&rdquo;[^9] The two men reacted just as they had thirty years before and burst out laughing, though they admitted that on that particular night they had indeed been reckless. The memory made them realise that their comrade Lofty had not come. Jim had so hoped to see him among the guests. Neither of them had heard any news of him, though Jim had run into him some years earlier on ANZAC Day, observed every 25&nbsp;April to commemorate the landing of Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli in Turkey, the site of New Zealand’s first major battle of the Great War. The two comrades admitted that they had never confided so much about their time in uniform; it was indeed hard to speak of it with loved ones who had neither seen nor lived through combat. Though they themselves had been the protagonists of that memory, they had long refused that role, like most members of the company, showing extraordinary reserve. Sharkey found himself regretting that their memories had never been set down in writing.

The day after the reunion, memories of the war years haunted Jim’s thoughts. One morning, the old man found himself struggling through his newspaper. Sunk back into his armchair, his gaze drifted beyond the window towards Mount Eden. He had barely finished reading a short column when he realised he had retained nothing of its content; instead, he had been thinking of the people he had met and the places he had been during the conflict. Pushing these images from his mind, Jim dutifully began the article again from the start. His attention was suddenly caught by a familiar name: Harold Howard. Reading it again, the name struck a particular chord with the former tunneller. Although Jim had hardly ever used it, he knew the man far better by his nickname: Lofty. His brother-in-arms had died on 7&nbsp;August 1948 at Auckland Hospital,[^10] the very day of the reunion of the former members of the tunnelling company. The funeral was to take place that afternoon at Waikumete Cemetery, in the suburb of Glen Eden, to the south-west of Auckland.

Jim did not hesitate to attend the ceremony. He stood back from the family, relatives and friends gathered around the open grave in one of the avenues of the veterans’ plot. With a grave expression, he listened as different speakers took turns to recall Lofty’s life. He felt he could not recognise his old comrade, now presented as a marine engineer, in the portrait painted by those close to him. His service in the tunnelling unit was passed over, as though no one knew what Lofty had done in the trenches of northern France. His participation in the First World War was barely mentioned. The old tunneller waited until the crowd had dispersed after the ceremony before approaching the grave. He paused for a moment in silence, then took from his pocket a small bright red silk poppy, which he laid beside the little bronze plaque set into the ground. This artificial flower, customarily worn at commemorations, symbolises remembrance of those who died in war and those who served in uniform. Jim’s gaze lingered for a long time on the poppy as the gravedigger came forward, shovel in hand, to fill in the grave. Like those of other veterans of the Great War, Lofty’s grave bears the initials &ldquo;NZEF&rdquo;, marking his service in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.[^11] It also carries his service number and his last known rank; some stones are proudly adorned with the fern, symbol of the country. Yet nowhere is there any mention of his time in the tunnelling company. While such an omission might seem understandable in the case of men like Gerald, it was far less so for Lofty and the rest of the unit. Unlike the headstones of infantrymen, which give the name of their regiment, the tunnellers were not allowed, in the name of standardising the graves, to have the name of their company engraved. Only the term too simple and too general indicates their corps: &ldquo;Engineers&rdquo;. This choice further consigned the men of the unit to oblivion after the war, just as the clearing of the old battlefields and the burying of their tunnels and works contributed to the disappearance of the distinctive traces of their labour.

Back in the house where he had lived since his demobilisation, which his sister had left him, Jim let himself fall, deep in thought, into his armchair. It now seemed obvious to him that writing was the only way to remedy the forgetting into which his comrades and his company had fallen. But the old man did not know how to handle words like a writer. He had begun a notebook, but had never got beyond the first page. His sentences were simple, sometimes clumsy, but always honest. As he read and reread the few lines he had written, the former tunneller hesitated to continue. Yet, as he went back over the events of the past few days, he felt he had a duty to bear witness. He turned the page, ready to go on with his memoirs. Everything had to be told, so that the memories of the underground war and of his comrades would never fade away.
