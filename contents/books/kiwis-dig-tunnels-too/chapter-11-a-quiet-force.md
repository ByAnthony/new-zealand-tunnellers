# Chapter 11: A Quiet Force

By an irony of fate, Lofty and Sharkey were now working on the surface, finally benefiting from better-quality air[^1]. Having fallen back to Arras, they found themselves at the heart of the fighting and took an active part in the defence of the city by digging trenches. The German offensive had in fact broken through the positions where the New Zealanders had been working for almost a year. The British rear lines, which had quickly become the new front, were not sufficiently fortified to withstand the enemy’s attacks. The lack of communications between the trenches drove all engineer forces—and not only the tunnellers—to rapidly create new lines.

The British Army was in rout. It lost around ten kilometres of ground, painfully won the previous year during the bloody Battle of Arras. Twenty-nine underground works—nineteen shelters, eight machine-gun nests, and two trench-mortar battery positions—begun between 22&nbsp;February and 17&nbsp;March 1918 were never completed, and all of the company’s works between Gavrelle and Guémappe—more than 300&nbsp;underground structures—fell into enemy hands. The front gave way between Arras and Soissons. In Picardy, German troops pushed beyond Péronne and as far as Montdidier. The Entente armies could do nothing but retreat. In Arras, the front line once again found itself close to the city centre[^2].

The New Zealanders’ camp came under bombardment and had to be moved outside the city. It was set up on land near the village of Dainville, west of Arras, sheltered behind the embankment of the railway line serving the Opal Coast via Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise. The men first put up tents, which were replaced by “half-moons,” prefabricated corrugated-iron huts. Every day, Lofty and Sharkey, like the other men, were carried by truck along the Warlus–Arras road to their various operational areas. This fast transport method avoided wasting time that was needed for the essential digging of the new trenches east of Arras[^3]. The front was made up of four types of lines: the front-line trenches in front, followed by cover trenches, support trenches, and finally reserve trenches. Communication trenches linked each line. The tunnellers therefore developed different positions according to the urgency of the British Army’s needs. Barely finished, the trenches were immediately used by infantry troops trying to withstand enemy attacks. Old communication trenches unused for eleven months were also restored. Former German lines were even converted into cover trenches. The company’s organization was thrown into upheaval. The sections no longer worked independently, but were mixed according to the tasks, and could thus reach more than 350&nbsp;men—effectively the unit’s entire strength.

Lofty, Sharkey, George, and the rest of the tunnellers kept digging without pause. No more than one or two days were needed to complete a trench. Work on shelters beneath the lines resumed to protect soldiers from shells and bombs. While a few men from Section&nbsp;4 were assigned to this task on 31&nbsp;March, in a trench near Ficheux, a shell landed close to the group. The explosion killed one man and wounded three others. The tunnellers’ situation was more dangerous than ever. The Germans were trying to claw back even the smallest stretch of ground. The Entente’s military and political leaders began to consider the possibility of defeat. Field Marshal Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, was uncertain about the battle’s outcome. The order of the day of 11&nbsp;April 1918 revealed the anxiety surrounding the operations:

> Many amongst us now are tired. To those I would say that Victory will belong to the side which holds out the longest&nbsp;[…] Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement&nbsp;[…] The safety of our Homes and the Freedom of mankind alike depend upon the conduct of each one of us at this critical moment.[^4]

Until the end of March 1918, the New Zealanders dug 13&nbsp;trenches between Ficheux and Dainville, while the Germans kept up the pressure on their opponent by launching regular assaults. A defensive line was even created inside Arras. Houses along the main boulevards were linked together, and some were reinforced to accommodate firing positions and machine-gun nests[^5]. A German advance was so feared that the tunnellers were ordered to lay mines under two lines of communication leading out from the village of Saint-Laurent-Blangy. Lieutenant Collyns and 27&nbsp;men installed a first charge of 340&nbsp;kilograms under the road leading to Fampoux and a second of 363&nbsp;kilograms under the highway in the direction of Feuchy. Ready on 1&nbsp;April, their detonation, if necessary, was entrusted to the engineers of the 4th&nbsp;Division.

The situation was slipping so far out of British control that the tunnellers had to be trained in machine-gun fire. Three machine guns were made available to them, and a firing range was built inside their camp. Lofty, Sharkey, George, and their comrades set about learning how to handle the machine gun and fired almost every day. They had to be ready to defend Arras to the end if the order was given.

Part of the men of Section&nbsp;3 resumed the cleaning and shoring-up work in the underground quarries, while the rest of the unit hurried on with its work on the surface. Former army buildings, as well as many billets that were too close to the new front line, had to be dismantled or simply demolished[^6]. The men were so busy with their duties that some forgot the order to go bathe and wash off the grime at Warlus[^7]. The whole company was working as never before, despite the cold and the arrival of snow during April. Three sections were still digging trenches east of Arras, while the last section worked in the quarries on the Ronville side. One team was still dismantling huts. On 16&nbsp;April, 14&nbsp;trucks loaded with metal plates from old huts drove to the rear. The next day, 18&nbsp;more trucks left Arras for the camp of the British engineers at Duisans. Another 1,483&nbsp;metal plates were dismantled during the day on 19&nbsp;April. The dismantling continued until the end of the month, making it possible to recover a large quantity of material. Nearly all the military installations had been removed. The tent of the Young Men’s Christian Association was taken down on 27&nbsp;April. The quarries of both networks beneath Arras were operational again, as were the cellars of the houses around the squares and the main boulevards. New trenches were still being dug.

At the end of April, the fighting slackened at Arras and in other parts of the front. The Germans had pushed in between Armentières and La Bassée, but they could not drive the British back toward the sea[^8]. A new operation was planned for the beginning of May in the Chemin des Dames sector to prevent French troops from coming to the aid of their British ally, who was under strength in the north. A second action was also planned in Flanders. The Arras front was not a priority for the German army.

The beginning of May was marked by a return to underground works beneath the trenches. In a few weeks, the tunnellers began 15&nbsp;underground billets and 8&nbsp;machine-gun nests along the front between Athies in the north and Beaurains in the south. The digging of trenches was not abandoned, however; 13&nbsp;new lines were created. Arras was still not safe. During their rest time, the men continued their training on the firing range—now with the rifle, and also with the bayonet under Lieutenant McKee. They became, in practice, soldiers in their own right. At dawn on 21&nbsp;May, the Germans launched assaults all along the front east of Arras. Every man, whatever his branch of service, was mobilized as long as he knew how to fire a rifle. Everyone was notified to hold his position no matter what and not to retreat. All the tunnellers, except the 3rd&nbsp;section—employed digging shelters for machine-gun nests—took up positions in a trench behind the front line[^9]. The anxiety must have been palpable for Lofty or George, who had never fought on the surface with a weapon in hand. Fortunately, they never entered combat, and by 10&nbsp;o’clock they were all sent back to their usual work.

Although the front had stabilized east of Arras, around the villages of Feuchy and Tilloy-les-Mofflaines, the British remained under German pressure to the south, near Agny, where the lines almost curved around the city. Underground works were therefore carried out as a priority in these trenches to strengthen them and thus prevent a German advance that could then encircle Arras. The tunnellers pushed through the work at a breakneck pace. Well-practised and used to its tasks, the company finished, on average, three works each day in June. At the same time, dismantling operations still continued, and demolitions began in early July. The bridges in the villages of Agnez-lès-Duisans, Duisans, Bray and Étrun, to the south-east of Arras, were destroyed to slow any possible German advance. The underground shelters were dug just as quickly as the previous month and were immediately occupied by the troops defending the city. But the Germans were becoming less and less dangerous. They could no longer gain even the smallest piece of ground. The British were taking the initiative again—for good. Part of the tunnellers quietly left Arras on 14&nbsp;July 1918. The rest of the company followed the next day, after handing over to the 2nd&nbsp;Canadian Engineer Division all the works that had been started at Arras[^10].

Loaded onto a truck, Lofty and Sharkey were transported about thirty kilometres south of Arras. Their convoy reached Marieux, a village in the Somme, near the border with the Pas-de-Calais department. The journey passed without incident. The unit was placed under the command of the British Fourth Corps. Setting up the camp kept their team busy while they waited for the arrival of their comrades. Once the company was complete, it continued to establish itself, building kitchens and bathhouses which, for lack of wood, could only be finished a few days later. Lofty and Sharkey at least had a straw mattress to sleep on and a roof over their heads. Although the two men were in good health, several dozen of their comrades were suddenly struck with fever and had to be evacuated[^11]. The unit’s doctors remained perplexed by the growing number of sick men and were unable to find the cause.

Lofty and Sharkey returned to the lines at Beauquesne with a first work party. The New Zealanders’ new sector was much quieter than Arras. The men were going to work mainly in a reserve trench system, about a kilometre and a half behind the front line. They would be neither troubled by gas nor by enemy offensives[^12]. The fever epidemic was spreading—highly virulent—and yet, as early as 17&nbsp;July, the Section&nbsp;1 had already begun six underground dugouts, the Section&nbsp;2 five, the Section&nbsp;3 seven, and the Section&nbsp;4 six. Lofty and Sharkey were assigned Chinese and Russian labourers. The latter were welcomed all the more warmly because they allowed the New Zealanders to gain an extra day of rest. Being of the Jewish faith, they observed Saturday. Lofty and Sharkey’s entire section was therefore given that same day off. For the sake of fairness, the other sections were assigned Sunday. The Marieux camp had an excellent canteen, and the YMCA tent set up beside it provided a range of entertainments. What a surprise it was for Lofty, Sharkey, or George to be able to share these as well with other New Zealanders. For the first time since their arrival in France, the company was in contact with the New Zealand Division, whose rest camp had been established in the same village[^13]. It was a real joy for the tunnellers to find themselves once again among their compatriots, talking about home and spending time together.

Despite the continuing shortage of timber, the company completed 48&nbsp;underground dugouts and 29&nbsp;machine-gun nests during the month of July. These works helped to round out the rather poorly organised trench system. The Chinese and Russian labourers, who had gradually been integrated into every team across all sections, left the company in haste on 5&nbsp;August. The tunnellers now had to shoulder all the work themselves, and in less than a day the schedule fell seriously behind[^14]. The next day, 200&nbsp;Chinese from the 188th&nbsp;Labour Company were assigned as Fatigues and, like their predecessors, distributed among the four sections. Each section received around twenty men, who proved to be excellent reinforcements. Even so, Lofty’s and George’s teams were still short of manpower. The constant shortage of timber significantly slowed the fitting-out of the underground works. This situation led to an unusual order: no new works were to be started. Issued on 17&nbsp;August, it was also reinforced by excellent news from British operations on the Somme.

On 8&nbsp;August, the British Fourth Army, supported by the French First Army, went on the offensive east of the city of Amiens. The Germans were taken by surprise. Misled by a major Allied counter-intelligence operation, they did not realise that Canadian and Australian shock troops had been dispatched there to play a decisive role. Accurate artillery fire, supported by tanks, cavalry, armoured vehicles, and air power, backed the British infantry assault. The Germans lost 30,000&nbsp;men, including 12,000&nbsp;prisoners, and nearly 450&nbsp;artillery pieces on the very first day of fighting[^15]. The Entente forces drove more than ten kilometres into the enemy’s defences. Their advance then became more difficult as the Germans reinforced their front. The Allied operations were halted to avoid excessively heavy losses. New series of attacks were organised, before the end of the month, north of Amiens.

On this Sunday, 18&nbsp;August, Lofty and Sharkey were enjoying a fine sunny afternoon, lying in the grass near their camp. Nearby, a few comrades were improvising a game of rugby on a makeshift field, in a jumble of shouts and laughter. In the morning, the whole company had been assembled and inspected, then dismissed for the rest of the day. These periods of rest were becoming more and more frequent. Some of the fortunate ones had even been granted leave, with departures also becoming increasingly regular since the beginning of July. If the officers, most of whom had already been allowed to leave the front, were able to take advantage of it in turn, they were soon followed by the rest of the men who had not yet gone. Lofty, like a few other tunnellers, had already enjoyed a period of leave. His stay in the British capital two months earlier had left a bitter taste, even though it had done him a world of good. Living in cultural and social deprivation at the front, the tunneller had been unable to resist the many distractions and had spent his money with surprising ease.

On Monday, 19&nbsp;August, the weather was still just as fine in the Somme sector, and the heat set in[^16]. Some of the tunnellers were sent to the baths, while, in the underground works still under construction, the teams carried on as usual. The next day, the men were again put at rest. On Wednesday, 21&nbsp;August 1918, the unit’s headquarters gave the order to stop work[^17]. The British Third and Fourth Armies had attacked in the sector between Arras and the Somme. The Germans, driven back, were unable to offer any resistance. The Allied counter-offensive was under way.
