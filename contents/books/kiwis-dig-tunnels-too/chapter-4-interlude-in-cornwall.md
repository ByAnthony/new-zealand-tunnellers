# Chapter 4: Interlude in Cornwall

The <em>Ruapehu</em> docked in the port of Plymouth, on the coast of Great Britain, at midday on 3&nbsp;February 1916. The final leg of the voyage passed without incident. For the tunnellers, the excitement of disembarkation was mingled with sadness at leaving the ship behind. The company went ashore without delay in driving rain, heading for the railway station to travel on to Falmouth, a coastal town about a hundred kilometres south-west of Plymouth, where the final phase of their training would take place.

Jim had left the <em>Ruapehu</em> in haste, disappointed that he could not linger longer to say goodbye to the crew and their captain. Soaked through, like his comrades, he waited for the train to arrive. As he watched a few boys trying to swindle some of the men by offering them a cup of tea they would never actually deliver, an elbow from Lofty drew his attention to an unexpected sight.[^1] A good dozen young women had clustered at the window of a factory opposite the quay, waving and smiling at the New Zealanders.[^2] Jim and Lofty began to cheer them, setting off their comrades in a hubbub of shouts and whistles that only the noise of the arriving train managed to drown out. The men piled into the carriages in high spirits, laughing faces turned towards the factory.

At Falmouth, the municipality offered the whole company a splendid welcome dinner. The beer was excellent—and much remarked upon; the waitresses too.[^3] Second Lieutenant Neill, who had found the atmosphere on board ship quite pleasant, now seemed to find the long weeks at sea rather monotonous once confronted with the fairer sex. Celebrating their return to land in grand style, a few men raised their voices in a song composed aboard the <em>Ruapehu</em> by Johnny Cullen and set to music by Sergeant Parnell. After the meal, the unit marched through the town in ranks to Hornwork Camp, set on a promontory beneath Pendennis Castle, built under Henry&nbsp;VIII. Tired after the lively evening, Jim went to his quarters to settle in and slip under the blankets. No sooner had their superiors turned away than Lofty and a few men from his team left camp to carry on the celebrations in town. The following night, Jim joined his comrades, won over by the tales of their escapades—in which, above all else, the girls were the centre of attention. If Jim’s small group was not caught on its return to camp, others were less lucky. Punishments quickly followed. Absences without leave and drunkenness multiplied to such an extent that the British sergeant in charge of supervision was dismayed by the New Zealanders’ indiscipline.[^4] The camp perimeter was nevertheless guarded constantly, day and night. Sentries were even posted on the roads leading to Hornwork Camp. Nothing helped: the tunnellers always found a way out, at any hour. The camp police’s best haul was a group of seventeen men who failed to answer roll call on the evening of 14&nbsp;February.[^5] The next day they were confined to their hut for several days. Sanctions deterred some, but others continued to break orders. The camp police therefore decided to impose heavier penalties. From 15&nbsp;February onwards, repeat offenders—or the most serious cases, meaning absences of more than two days—had deductions made from their pay.[^6] The severity of the punishments sharply reduced the number of men absent without leave. Four cases were still discovered the following day, but by 17 February they were dealt with separately. The tunnellers were not prisoners, however. While their military status required them to remain in camp during the week, the New Zealanders were entitled to weekend leave.

Rather than spending his Saturday afternoons and Sundays drinking in the pubs of Falmouth, Jim preferred to join Sergeant Tom Jones and Lance Corporal Francis Clifford. The three of them took to the roads and visited Truro Cathedral, along with other local sights. Jim’s enlistment in the army was a chance to live an extraordinary adventure at the far end of the world from the Dominion—an opportunity he knew how to seize. More than anyone, Jim relished these moments of discovery, he who had risked everything to join the tunnellers’ ranks. Each day satisfied his curiosity a little more. With his companions, he discovered the Bassett Arms, a hotel and pub nestled in the Portreath valley, only a few hundred metres from the beach. Quickly striking up a friendship with the landlady and her two daughters, Tom, Francis and Jim returned every weekend until they left for France. In the cosy atmosphere of the Bassett Arms parlour, they spent pleasant evenings by the hearth in the company of locals. As the weeks went by, Sergeant Jones grew closer and closer to one of the daughters. He was not the only one to become involved. Lofty too fell for an Englishwoman who was already sending him gifts at camp. One day he received a handkerchief embroidered with the words of a song well known among Commonwealth soldiers, &ldquo;Keep the Home Fires Burning,&rdquo; written by Lena Ford and set to music by Ivor Novello.[^7] Lofty sang it several times with his mate Jim in their hut. The words—which Lofty kept on him at all times—took on a special resonance for him and his comrades, for as the song says:

> Though your lads are far away<br>
> They dream of home<br>
> There's a silver lining<br>
> Through the dark clouds shining<br>
> Turn the dark cloud inside out<br>
> 'Til the boys come home<br>

At Hornwork Camp, the training programme still focused on revising close-order drill, marching, and rifle exercises. Morning and afternoon instruction was provided by Sergeants O’Brien, Mahony and Blight—three English instructors from the 7th&nbsp;Royal Fusiliers, an elite infantry regiment of the British Army, seconded to the small New Zealand unit.[^8] O’Brien became the most popular instructor among the tunnellers. He was a hard man with a fierce temper. The drills he ran were conducted at a furious pace, under a barrage of barked and shouted orders.[^9] Whenever he spotted recruits falling out of step during parade, his face would turn scarlet and he would shout even louder to dress them down. The tunnellers struggled with this punishing regime. One day, during a close-order drill, O’Brien had nearly a hundred men march around the camp canteen. The column, moving faster and faster, kept circling again and again. With each circuit, an exhausted tunneller dropped out of the ranks and collapsed to the ground. The exercise ended with only twenty-five men still on their feet.[^10] O’Brien demanded a great deal of recruits who were barely trained, and he remained dismayed by their lack of practice.[^11] To him, the New Zealanders were not soldiers—and never would be. Yet O’Brien still hoped that the tunnellers would prove capable in the task for which they were intended.

The unit’s officers held their men in high regard when it came to driving galleries. According to Second Lieutenant Neill, no one could teach them that skill.[^12] Yet underground fighting did not consist of that work alone. The War Office in London had not altered its plans: since there was no qualified instructor in New Zealand, the New Zealanders were to receive training in underground warfare. That training, however, could not take place until the company reached the front. All the mining schools—newly created and still few in number—were located in France. They had been established because of the growing number of casualties from carbon monoxide inhalation, released by underground explosions, in the summer of 1915. While their teaching was initially limited to underground rescue, it was expanded to include the rudiments of tunnelling work at the beginning of 1916. In the meantime, the training programme at Falmouth introduced field exercises—pick and shovel in hand—to prepare the tunnellers for the various engineering tasks imposed by positional warfare. Jim, Lofty, George, Gerald and the rest of the men of the 1st and 2nd&nbsp;Sections began this new training together. It started at 8.30&nbsp;p.m. and ran through much of the night, finishing around 4.30&nbsp;a.m. They spent two consecutive nights digging trenches and creating fortified positions, before giving way to their comrades of the 3rd and 4th&nbsp;Sections for the next two nights. The same rotation was maintained each week throughout February, simply changing the order in which sections took their turn. George and Gerald spent their time in a trench they had begun to dig and whose layout they continued to develop. They also received a practical lesson in the use of explosives and were shown real charges. The officers reminded them of the necessary precautions to prevent accidents.

At the end of February, the company prepared for its final journey to war. The tunnellers received their digging equipment and packed their kit. The Army Service Corps attached to the unit took delivery of trucks, motorbikes and horses that would be useful in France. New Zealand’s High Commissioner in London—its senior diplomat and plenipotentiary—Sir Thomas McKenzie, reviewed the tunnellers shortly before their departure. He passed on a message from the British Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, urging them to &ldquo;worthily uphold Anzac traditions&rdquo;[^13]—the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps that had fought and suffered heavy losses at Gallipoli. One officer and sixty-nine men remained at Falmouth as reinforcements; they were later transferred to the New Zealand forces’ command depot at Hornchurch, east of London. For Jim and his comrades, the farewells were moving. On 7&nbsp;March 1916, the company left Hornwork Camp under the gaze of their three English instructors and a few men from the 7th&nbsp;Royal Fusiliers. The whole town had gathered along the route to applaud and cheer them on. The unit was carried on to Southampton, where its men boarded a ferry at 5&nbsp;p.m. on 9&nbsp;March. After a few hours of a cold night on the Channel, the New Zealand tunnelling company reached the port of Le Havre at midnight.[^14] It became the first New Zealand unit to join the Western Front. Above all, it arrived at a moment when Britain’s underground situation was far from satisfactory.

New underground fighters were still taking up positions along the line each week, while the equipment and administration of the tunnelling companies improved day by day. Since the announcement of the New Zealand tunnellers’ formation, Britain had managed to raise a further nine companies. Canada even formed a unit directly in the trenches while awaiting the arrival of two other contingents raised in the Dominion. Personnel were identified within the two Canadian divisions deployed in France and transferred into the 3rd&nbsp;Canadian Tunnelling Company, which became the first Dominion unit in action on the Western Front—at Sainte-Marie-Cappel, south of Cassel (Nord)—at the end of 1915. Defensive underground systems had been built only in a few strategic places. Along the rest of the line, tunnellers were caught up in piecemeal local operations in which the enemy often had the upper hand, but without strategic effect.[^15]
