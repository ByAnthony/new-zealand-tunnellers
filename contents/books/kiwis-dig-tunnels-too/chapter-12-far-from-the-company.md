# Chapter 12: Far from the Company

At the beginning of 1917, Jim was taken to the military hospital at Frévent, about forty kilometres west of Arras. Before leaving, he had carefully washed all the clothes in his kit and taken a bath in order to avoid spreading lice and other vermin[^1]. Those precautions proved largely ineffective, however. Jim woke on the first morning covered in lice. The sheets had not been properly disinfected. The tunneller had no choice but to put on his clean things, which were immediately infested. Aside from that problem, the hospital was a peaceful place. Jim was lucky enough to enjoy fine sunny days. The surrounding countryside was ideal for going for a few walks. At tea time, Jim would sit at a table and talk with other patients in the shade of tall trees. To his great surprise, the New Zealander found himself surrounded by men from all corners of the Empire: to his right sat a Canadian, to his left an Australian, and opposite him a South African[^2].

His stay was short, however. Four days later, Jim boarded a hospital train bound for Étaples. Set on a small hill near the town’s railway station and overlooking the North Sea, the camp housed the largest British military complex on the Western Front. It contained several hospitals, with hundreds of seemingly endless rows of grey tents capable of treating 40,000&nbsp;wounded and sick men. The site also served as a billet for troops in transit.

A sergeant took charge of the men who, like Jim, were able to walk. The group was led to the baths, where each man undressed. All their clothing was taken away. Personal belongings were gathered into a bundle and would be returned later. Naked, Jim waited his turn to step into a bathtub filled with hot water[^3]. He soaped himself under the sergeant’s watchful eye and, when the sergeant was satisfied, he was allowed to get out, dry off, and put on a clean uniform. Taken to the mess, the tunnelier enjoyed an excellent meal[^4]. Then, at last, he was able to enjoy a cosy, louse-free bed in a Canadian hospital.

The New Zealanders were generally grouped within their own medical facility, but the shortage of beds made it impossible to keep them all there at the same time. Over the course of 1917, more than twelve thousand New Zealanders, from all units combined, were evacuated in France and Great Britain. A large proportion were sent to other hospitals while they waited for new places to become available[^5]. Jim therefore did not remain with the Canadians for long. After four days, he was transferred to the New Zealand base camp. Seeing his compatriots again was, however, harder than mixing with men from other parts of the Empire[^6]. Jim witnessed a strange scene during his first meal in the mess hall. The moment the cooks opened the door to serve the men, everyone surged toward them like rugby players in a scrum, leaving only meagre scraps for the tunnelier. This situation was due to the mix of soldiers whose links to their units had been broken. Officers were separated from their men, so communication and discipline were difficult to maintain among the camp’s population[^7]. The men were left to themselves at the very moment when they most needed their comrades and their superiors.

After several days of waiting, three doctors finally examined Jim. The tunneller’s back was manhandled for a few minutes, so much so that Jim began to feel worse and worse. His hernia absolutely had to be operated on. The procedure would not take place at the Étaples hospital, but in Great Britain. Jim’s name was therefore put down for the next departure, on the following Tuesday. Two days before leaving the camp, a sergeant who had contracted mumps was placed in the same tent as Jim. Everyone who might have been in direct contact was put into isolation. Jim was therefore sent to a quarantine camp, on the Boulogne road, a few kilometres north of Étaples. Living conditions there were appalling: the place was surrounded by fences nearly three metres high topped with barbed wire, and it felt more like a prison. The men were confined to their tents, with no activities. The camp itself had hardly any leisure facilities: no library, no room for writing, no hall where people could gather. A few young French girls sold newspapers through the fences, including the French edition of the Daily Mail, as well as sweets. However, this little trade ended quickly when the officers in charge of the camp discovered that the candies were filled with rum. After 28&nbsp;days of hell in the coldest, bleakest place he had ever known, Jim was sent back to the Étaples camp. He received no information about a new departure date for Great Britain.

The tunneller’s wandering made him realise the harsh reality of military hospitals and the role of doctors who, while they had to treat their patients, also had to send them back into combat. One of Jim’s tentmates was in such a bad way that the New Zealander thought he would be sent to Great Britain without even being examined[^8]. Yet when he was seen by the doctors, they looked him over carefully, made him walk forwards and backwards like a puppet, and finally decided to send him back to his unit. Jim grew increasingly exasperated with Étaples. Living conditions were still precarious, and his stay in hospital dragged on with no prospect of surgery. Jim nevertheless found some comfort in the company of a few former mates from his company who had recently been admitted. These contacts made him want to return to the trenches. The tunneller took advantage of the fact that one of his comrades, Gordon Graydon, knew a doctor at the camp to secure an official departure[^9]. Making use of the presence at Étaples of a draft of reinforcements for his unit—the 3rd—who had left New Zealand in November 1916, Jim and other veterans joined it for its final journey to the front.

The tunneller’s state of health did not, however, allow him to rejoin his digging team. The company doctor, Dr Richards, granted him an exemption without hesitation and asked for him to be assigned to a much less physically demanding duty. For Jim, nothing gave him greater pleasure than being back among his mates and finding an occupation that allowed him to escape the boredom of hospitals[^10]. At first, the officers gave him the task of censoring his comrades’ mail. After a few days, they appointed him assistant to Quartermaster-Sergeant Thomas Rainbow, whose role was to provide the men with basic necessities, to source and distribute food, to manage ammunition and equipment, and to obtain any other supplies useful to the company. Jim therefore had to collect rations from the division store and deliver them to the forward billets at the front[^11]. His return to the forward lines allowed him to see Lofty again, who had not imagined his friend was still in France. After two months apart, their reunion was warm, enlivened by the telling of their escapades. Jim would gladly have traded his ration deliveries for digging work, but his health remained a concern, and his superiors worried about him.

At the end of June, Jim was granted ten days’ leave. Before he left, Lieutenant Holmes congratulated him on the Military Medal he had received for his excellent conduct in the trenches, especially during the night Lieutenant Durant and Sergeant Pownceby disappeared. He also used the conversation to share his worries about Jim’s back problems. The lieutenant advised the tunneller to report sick during his leave and try to obtain an operation. He all but ordered him not to come back[^12]. At the end of his leave, on 9 July 1917, Jim went to see a military doctor before embarking for France. His condition was judged critical, and the tunneller was transferred to the New Zealand hospital at Walton-on-Thames, in Surrey, about twenty kilometres south-west of London. This establishment primarily received New Zealand casualties disembarking at Dover. Those landing at Southampton were sent on to a second hospital, located at Brokenhurst, in Hampshire, about fifteen kilometres from Southampton[^13]. To this arrangement were added two main convalescent camps at Hornchurch and Codford. The first, near London, could accommodate around 1,000&nbsp;people[^14]. The second was on Salisbury Plain, nearly fifty kilometres north-west of Southampton, with 2,500 to 3,000&nbsp;beds[^15]. It was originally intended to replace the Hornchurch camp, but the large number of wounded prevented its closure.

At Walton-on-Thames, Jim underwent another medical examination that put his spine under severe strain. After bending his patient forward and straightening him up several times, the doctor explained to Jim that, between two of his vertebrae, the intervertebral disc—a kind of shock absorber—had been damaged, creating a hernia. A surgical operation was required to relieve the compression of certain nerve roots that was causing his recurrent pain. Three days later, the tunneller went into the operating theatre and had to remain in bed for three weeks[^16]. Not fully recovered, he was granted two additional weeks in another hospital, installed in a hotel requisitioned by the War Office and assigned to New Zealanders, in the nearby town of Weybridge. The vast wooded park surrounding the large 18th-century red-brick house gave him the illusion that he was in paradise. The tunneller quickly struck up a friendship with Mick Walsh, a soldier who had lost a leg. The two of them joked all day long and, above all, found a shared hobby in sports betting. Jim was soon back on his feet, and then was dispatched to the convalescent camp at Hornchurch.

If Weybridge had been a haven of peace, Hornchurch was the complete opposite. The camp had a rehabilitation and training section for men coming out of hospital. Three different categories were distinguished[^17]. The first, Class A, was reserved for soldiers physically ready to return to their unit. The second, Class B, included men who needed training but could be sent back to the front within six months. The last category, Class C, was for individuals deemed unfit for active service and who were waiting to be transferred to New Zealand. Enrolled in Class B, Jim had to carry out intense exercises and take part in military parades only five weeks after his operation. His back could not cope, and the tunneller was put on rest[^18]. Jim changed camp once again and was sent to the New Zealand Engineers’ camp at Boscombe, in the suburbs of Bournemouth, on the English Channel coast.

Kept permanently away from the training ground, the tunneller was assigned to work with a cook and his assistant in the camp’s sergeants’ mess. The days passed quietly between taking delivery of supplies and preparing meals. At the start of 1918, two weeks of leave gave Jim the chance to return to the places he had discovered two years earlier when he first arrived in Great Britain. The New Zealander found his way back to the Basset Arms, the hotel and pub where he had stayed over several weekends with his friends from that time, Sergeant Tom Jones and Lance-Corporal Francis Clifford[^19]. As he went in, the landlady spoke to him like any ordinary customer, but her daughter immediately recognised Jim and, forgetting what she was doing, threw her arms around his neck[^20]. The best room was prepared for him at once. Jim did not have time to refuse the offer: he was ushered to the bar, a pint of beer set down in front of him, and encouraged to give news of himself and of his companions. His base on the Cornish coast then became the starting point for several excursions.

Nostalgic, the sapper allowed himself a day in Falmouth, the town where the tunnellers’ camp had been set up for their final training before leaving for France, in February 1916. Jim wandered along the seafront, past tall houses with white façades and grey-tiled roofs. Several passers-by looked at him closely, studying the badges pinned to his uniform. One of them came up, hesitated to ask him a question, but in the end could not resist asking whether he was a New Zealander. The people of Falmouth had not forgotten the visit of the tunnellers from the Antipodes[^21]. Jim was soon surrounded by a small group of men and women, pressing him to give news of his unit and his comrades.

In the evening, at the Basset Arms, Jim drank his beer quietly by the hearth, still accompanied by one or more regulars. Toward the end of the night, Mrs Coad, the landlady, and her two daughters joined him for a brief chat before going upstairs to bed. The tunneller enjoyed these moments, which passed far too quickly. His leave was drawing to a close, and his return to Boscombe was approaching. Before he left, Mrs Coad wrote the Basset Arms address on a small piece of paper in case Jim wanted to keep in touch. The sapper promised to write to the whole family as soon as he could. On the day he departed, the landlady insisted that Jim pay nothing, making the farewells even harder. Hardly had he returned to the Boscombe camp, where he resumed his kitchen duties, than the tunneller sent his hosts a warm letter of thanks.

At the end of February 1918, still convalescing, Jim appeared before the doctors. Although the operation had relieved some of his pain, he still felt tension in his back. Any physical effort was now impossible for him and would only cause irreversible damage. Jim was therefore classified as unfit for active service and placed on the list of men to be sent back to New Zealand[^22]. The sapper, who had been corresponding with his sister since his arrival in Europe, hastened to pass on the news to her, now waiting impatiently for the day of departure. But no date was set. Days followed one another, soon giving way to weeks and then months, without any notice of demobilisation. Life at the Boscombe camp went on, fairly quietly, and Jim, still working in the kitchens, swapped a few provisions for small favours from the sergeants he met in the mess[^23]. That way he could go out every evening and was never troubled when he returned late. At weekends, the tunneller set off along the English roads to discover the surrounding villages and towns. He was especially fond of Christchurch Priory, wedged between the arms of the Rivers Avon and Stour and surrounded by its wooded grounds. Each visit revealed new architectural features, unusual and steeped in history.

During his wanderings, Jim met a woman whom he soon saw again. Very much in love, he invited her several times to join him on his walks and to go dancing in the evenings at the clubs in Bournemouth. The relationship ended abruptly when the sapper raised the possibility that she might come and join him in New Zealand as soon as he had returned. Even though Jim liked the south of Great Britain, he remained deeply attached to his Dominion, which he very much hoped to see again. The uncertainty surrounding his departure frustrated him all the more because his sister expected, with every letter, to read news of his embarkation.

At the beginning of September 1918, the sapper finally told him that he would soon be going back. Transferred to Torquay, a town on the English Channel in the county of Devon, his departure for New Zealand was imminent. Unfortunately, hardly had he arrived when Jim was struck by severe headaches, followed by chills and an intense feeling of cold. No blanket, however thick, could warm him. Admitted to the Red Cross hospital, Jim had the symptoms of the &ldquo;Spanish flu,&rdquo; which had just reached the town[^24]. This virus had spread rapidly across North America and Europe in the spring of 1918, before extending to the rest of the world[^25]. New Zealand was affected a few months later, at a time when the epidemic seemed to be receding in Europe. The illness resembled an ordinary flu and caused few deaths during the first wave. From August onward, new cases showing a malignant form of the disease began to appear in France and Great Britain. Contagion was difficult to contain because the virus was so virulent. No one had the slightest idea of its origin or how to treat the victims. Faced with the influx of sick people, both civilian and military, volunteers reinforced the teams of nurses in Torquay. Jim, wedged between two other victims, was feverish and slipped into a dazed state, full of dreams and at times delirious. The tunneller nevertheless came back to himself after fifteen days. His neighbours had not been so lucky and had died in dreadful suffering. As he was carried to another part of the hospital, Jim could see the faces of victims speckled with brownish or purplish spots, their feet turning black. He heard some patients choking, struggling to clear their airways of the fluids released by the infection. An overwhelming fatigue kept him in bed for long weeks. Jim recovered slowly, surrounded by good wardmates, most of them from the United States of America, and with whom the tunneller quickly struck up friendships[^26]. Nearly one and a half million American soldiers had already crossed the Atlantic by October 1918. While troop movements had accelerated its spread, the Spanish flu also forged its own path across the world. The emergence of the second wave in Europe coincided, in the weeks that followed, with others in parts of the globe as far apart as South Africa, Japan, China, and Peru.

By late October, Jim had regained his strength. He was able to leave the hospital and rejoin the military camp at Torquay, where he was ordered to prepare his kit for the return journey. In early November, he was crammed with other New Zealand soldiers into a train for Plymouth, then embarked aboard the Ayrshire. This troopship was far from matching the Ruapehu, the vessel that had brought Jim and his companions to Great Britain three years earlier. The beds were poor, the food was too, and the voyage across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans was a dreary one[^27]. Although overjoyed at the news of the Armistice, Jim was frustrated that he could not take part in the peace celebrations. He and his companions nevertheless received, during their stopover at Cristobal, a port on Panama’s Pacific coast, a very warm welcome—patriotic songs, cigarettes and bananas handed out, and crowds thronging around them. This landing undoubtedly contrasted with their arrival in New Zealand on Christmas Eve[^28]. And for good reason: the Dominion was only just recovering from the second wave of the Spanish flu, which had struck severely for the past two months. Although the epidemic was contained, the number of infected people was still significant. The atmosphere in the city shocked Jim so deeply that he felt as if he were returning to a morgue[^29]. He was all the more shaken because a pastor had come to see him shortly before he set foot on land. The man told him of his sister’s death, carried off by the terrible virus a month earlier. It was a devastating shock for the tunneller, who could not imagine a worse homecoming.

Discipline problems did not end with the close of the conflict: from January to May 1919, a large number of riots broke out while demobilized men waited to return to New Zealand.
