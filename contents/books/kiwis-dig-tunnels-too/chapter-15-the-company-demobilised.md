# Chapter 15: The Company Demobilised

As a keen rugby fan, Sharkey stood at the edge of the pitch, his cap pulled down over his head, hands in his pockets to better fend off the cold. He was talking tactics with a few mates, who were using broad gestures to mime how to break through the opposing defence. On the grass, the company’s rugby team was facing a selection made up of soldiers from the XXIIth&nbsp;Army Corps[^1]. After a hard-fought first half, the New Zealanders had returned to their bench two points down: 6–8. The restart did not go their way, and the English, very much on the front foot, even slotted a penalty to add three points. The New Zealand team did not let up, however, and immediately went back on the attack, forcing a bruising contest on their opponents. An English infringement allowed the tunnellers back into the match, cutting the XXIIth&nbsp;Corps selection’s lead to two points. Cheered on by Sharkey and his comrades, the tunnellers’ side kept possession but ran into an impenetrable defence. Another English fault conceded a scrum to the New Zealanders just a few metres from the try line. Fed into the pack, the ball was quickly hooked back and gathered by the scrum-half, who shipped it to one of his players surging down the touchline, breaking the defensive line and scoring a try. The tunnellers converted the kick, decisively taking the lead: 14–11.

This victory lifted the spirits of the tunnellers a little, even though the demobilisation order still had not arrived. Lofty, who had spent the second half alongside one of his officers, was unable to find out anything more to tell Sharkey and his mates. No steps had been taken to release the tunnellers, although a few men had already left the unit. Yet the company’s demobilisation was a special case. It was due to begin well before that of New Zealand soldiers in other units, which was not ordered until the start of 1919. The presence of miners, engineers, and public-works labourers justified the need for a swift return[^2]. The other tunnelling companies met the same fate and left France as quickly as they had arrived from the end of February 1915 onward[^3]. As early as 25&nbsp;November, Major Vickerman, commanding the company, had cabled the list of his men to the headquarters of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, requesting their departure. But no arrangements seemed to have been made. The unit still contained a high proportion of men from the Main Body and the 1st&nbsp;Reinforcements; 65%&nbsp;of the tunnellers were original volunteers. Officers and other ranks from the 1915 intake were therefore, logically, the first to be ordered to stand by for demobilisation on 26&nbsp;December.

The New Zealanders, who wanted to finish the drainage operations at Spiennes in Belgium, were authorised to retain enough men to complete their final task. Lofty, who was due to be demobilised, volunteered to stay with Sharkey and his comrades of Section&nbsp;1. Thus, on the evening of 27&nbsp;December, only half of the tunnellers scheduled to depart made their way to the Valenciennes depot, on the other side of the border—namely a group of two officers and 65&nbsp;other ranks.

At Lourches, Captain Daldy and 18&nbsp;men were demobilised. The remaining thirty-odd tunnellers were left under Lieutenant Cooper’s command to finish the bridge construction work, before rejoining the unit at Spiennes. George, who was among those being demobilised, realised as he packed his kit that it was all over. Home was no longer just an idea he dreamed of from time to time—it was truly the destination of his final journey in uniform.

More than ever, manpower was short. The nearly 250&nbsp;tunnellers still at work were reorganized into two sections: the first made up mostly of men from the 1916 intake, and the second from the 1917 intake. Despite the departure of part of the unit, pressure from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence remained strong to have the entire company leave Europe[^4]. As demobilization requests from almost all armies multiplied, finding transport to cross the Channel became increasingly difficult. In anticipation, all equipment was nevertheless returned to the British engineers’ stores, and packs were kept ready on 6&nbsp;January 1919. The New Zealanders were therefore unable to complete the drainage work at Spiennes, as they had so much wanted, and had to leave the final operations to the Belgian authorities. While waiting to depart, close-order drill—interspersed with a few rugby matches and rest periods—was organized every day. But no orders came. Tired of waiting, the officers put their men back to work from 14&nbsp;January, assigning them to a demolition operation at the Mons slaughterhouses. The men in Sharkey’s group would have liked to finish the task they had been given, both to avoid boredom and to forget that their departure would not be happening anytime soon.

In leaving Sharkey and his comrades so abruptly, Lofty had not, however, been demobilized. He had been evacuated to Codford Hospital in England to be treated for a venereal disease, probably contracted during his last leave in London in July 1918. Despite all the precautions taken by the administration of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force—following the advice of Ettie Rout, a New Zealand volunteer with the Women’s Welfare League—the recommendations given to men on leave were not necessarily followed. Every New Zealand soldier who arrived in the capital of the Empire did, however, receive an illustrated lecture on venereal diseases, as well as one or more boxes of condoms depending on the length of his stay, for the purpose of protection and not as a contribution to vice[^5]. But those promises evaporated when soldiers feasted their eyes on the young women they met in the street. Less discreet than their Parisian counterparts, London prostitutes solicited rather than merely hinted, and rarely failed in their work of picking up clients[^6]. Lofty’s imprudence earned him an appropriate course of treatment lasting several weeks, which prevented him from leaving Europe with his company.

The distinctive nature of the tunnellers’ demobilization lay in the fact that they were transferred back to New Zealand in groups of varying size. Unlike the very first demobilized men who had left France in the weeks following the Armistice—and unlike New Zealand soldiers in general—the remaining men did not travel in isolation from their comrades. They were supervised by their own officers and NCOs all the way home, which limited disciplinary problems. The last two sections, including Sharkey’s, were even demobilized as a complete unit—an exceptional measure for which the only other example within the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was the Māori Pioneer Battalion[^7]. The military authorities quickly exempted both units from garrison service in Germany. In the case of the Māori, it seemed inappropriate for indigenous troops to be stationed in a European country. For the tunnellers, the reason was more economic: their skills, though useful in Europe, were simply required on the other side of the globe.

The demobilization order finally reached Major Vickerman on 21&nbsp;January. The next day, late in the afternoon, his company left Belgium. Sharkey found himself crammed with his comrades into the back of one of twelve trucks hired to take them to Mons station. The journey was short, but still exhausting, because the wind that blew through the many holes in the bodywork was bitterly cold[^8]. In a sorry state, the truck had no heating system at all. Sharkey curled in on himself, arms crossed, hands tucked under his armpits, trying to keep warm. Beside him, one of his shivering mates clasped his hands in front of his mouth and gently blew warm air into them. None of these tricks helped. The tunnellers felt a certain relief when they changed modes of transport in Mons. Unfortunately, the train convoy consisted only of freight wagons with no insulation whatsoever. The cold was compounded by the train’s slow progress toward the French coast: in six hours, only 35&nbsp;kilometres were covered! Sharkey was mentally exhausted, like the rest of the men, who already imagined themselves on the other side of the Channel. Instead of England, the tunnellers spent the night in a school next to the station at Raismes, north of Valenciennes, with nothing to lift their spirits but tea[^9]. On 23&nbsp;January, at&nbsp;7 a.m., they boarded the same train again, hoping not to relive the previous day’s ordeal. As snow fell, the convoy moved at a good pace, reaching Douai, then Arras, Saint-Pol, and arriving that evening in Étaples. The trip had been punishing. Almost no food had been distributed. Only a cold, unappetizing ration of biscuits and corned beef was meant to satisfy their stomachs. Many men suffered from frostbite. Sapper Thomas Morris was even evacuated to hospital as soon as they got off the train, so badly was he affected by the cold[^10]. If Sharkey and his comrades thought their troubles were over when they finally sat down to a hot meal, their respite was brief. The entire company was housed for the night in tents[^11]!

Assembled at 2&nbsp;a.m., the men—close to freezing—set off with their packs on their backs toward the military training ground, where a train bound for Le Havre was waiting for them. Their lot did not improve. The carriages were still freight wagons with no heating system. Worse, the convoy moved so slowly along the Abbeville–Romescamps–Rouen–Le Havre line that, inside their wagon, Sharkey and most of his comrades could not take this numbing journey any longer. Nearly 24&nbsp;hours after leaving Étaples, the unit finally disembarked in Le Havre and marched straight to one of the city’s camps. The last French stage included the usual disinfection of the men in order to prevent lice and other vermin from being brought over to England. The departure date, however, was still unknown. As the days passed with no news, the green light was finally given on the morning of 29&nbsp;January. At midday, the company boarded the S.S.&nbsp;<em>Lydia</em>, which ran the crossing to the other side of the Channel. At 2:30&nbsp;p.m., with the moorings cast off, Sharkey watched the shoreline recede—like so many of his comrades—taking his final farewell of France.

While waiting to depart for New Zealand, the company was first stationed at the New Zealand depot at Larkhill, on the Salisbury Plain. This former reserve and training camp was converted into a repatriation centre for New Zealand soldiers as soon as the war ended. As when they first left for Europe, the men were examined by the dentist and then by a doctor. The New Zealand government renewed its request to have the unit leave Europe as soon as possible[^12]. A possible slot was found, but no departure would take place for at least a month. The limited number of ships made rapid embarkation difficult, especially since dockworkers had gone on strike to protest the very short notice with which the various departures of demobilised men from the Empire were being organised, and were therefore demanding a wage increase[^13]. The company was then transferred to Camp No.&nbsp;3 at Durrington, not far from Larkhill, to prepare their packs and, above all, what they would need for the return voyage. It took only a few hours for the tunnellers’ belongings to be packed up. Brigadier-General Stewart, the camp commandant, needed no more time to set the departure date for 25&nbsp;February. The pressure from the New Zealand government was such that the situation had to be settled as quickly as possible. An alphabetical list of the men was drawn up for this purpose. The packs were kept at the camp while Sharkey and his comrades were granted 14&nbsp;days’ leave, with orders to report to Codford Camp by 22&nbsp;February. Brigadier-General Stewart arranged for their belongings to be transferred to the tunnellers’ rendezvous point[^14].

When they returned from leave, the departure was postponed to a later date: the ship had not yet arrived in port. The men who wished to could go back on leave until 3&nbsp;March. Exasperated, Sharkey preferred to remain at Camp No.&nbsp;15 at Codford, following the example of some of his officers. To pass the time, work parties were organised to keep day-to-day life inside the camp running smoothly. Fatigue nevertheless spread among the NCOs. The war diary, in which the tunnellers’ tasks were recorded day by day, stopped on 28&nbsp;February, more than two weeks before the departure for New Zealand. The officer responsible for writing it no longer had much to note, since the days were all alike as they waited for embarkation. When the men on leave returned, the departure was definitively set for 14&nbsp;March. The packs that had been unpacked were prepared again and inspected once more. The unit, under the command of Captain Daldy, was taken by train to Southampton, where it embarked aboard the S.S.&nbsp;<em>Ionic</em>, an ocean liner built in 1902 and requisitioned to carry it home.

The voyage was relatively calm. A few duties had been put in place to ensure the ship stayed clean. Classes in a variety of subjects were organised every day, and the men were encouraged to attend at least three hours per day. But, as usual, Sharkey devoted himself to his favourite activity: lying on the deck, his head sunk into a pillow. The ship, rolling gently on the Atlantic swells, lulled him to sleep. Beside him, men lying down or sitting chatted or played cards. Further away, others were absorbed in books taken from the shelves of the on-board library. Even the NCOs, jackets unbuttoned, reduced their role to simply maintaining discipline and enjoyed the cruise. Nearly 500&nbsp;other soldiers from various branches shared the liner with the tunnelling unit, as well as 17&nbsp;nurses from the New Zealand Army Nursing Service, whose members were beginning to be repatriated in increasingly large groups. Suddenly, Sharkey was roused from his doze by the cries of a baby. Sitting up, he muttered as he adjusted his cap and saw a mother, rocking her child in her arms, moving away toward the aft deck. More than 160&nbsp;women—married to tunnellers and New Zealand soldiers during the conflict—were now following their husbands to their new country, accompanied by some sixty very young children. Still stiff, Sharkey rose slowly and leaned on the railing. His gaze swept the horizon, then drifted off, lost in thought, over the Atlantic waves. Unflinchingly, the <em>Ionic</em> made for the Caribbean Sea. Its route took it through the Panama Canal, avoiding the long passage around the southern tip of the continent, Cape Horn, as the _Ruapehu_ had done at the very beginning of 1916[^15].

The transit through the Canal—made up of a series of waterways, two artificial lakes, and several sets of locks—broke the monotony of the previous weeks at sea. The liner offered its passengers a peaceful cruise across the Isthmus of Panama, divided by a mountain range to which a lush tropical forest clung. Once the final channels had been negotiated, the Gulf of Panama opened onto the Pacific Ocean. Leaving Central America’s west coast behind, the ship found itself alone again on the open water. Activities just as varied as before—concerts, film screenings, and all kinds of competitions—were organised and open to anyone who wished to take part, led by a member of the Young Men’s Christian Association[^16]. Time passed fairly quickly. The passengers were drawing nearer to their return home, to their communities, and to their loved ones.

With New Zealand now close at hand, a grand farewell dinner was prepared and held on 20&nbsp;April. The menu Sharkey found when he sat down at the table was all the more tempting: spring consommé to start, then a wide choice of main courses including, among others, salmon fillet with hollandaise sauce, beef fillet à la Parisienne, Vermont turkey served with cranberry sauce, grilled ham with spinach, and lamb—everything accompanied by carrot purée and rice, with potatoes and cold meats available in unlimited quantities—washed down with wine, and finished with a selection of desserts including brandy-soaked pudding, cheeses, and coffee[^17]. As the dishes kept coming, conversation flowed freely. Barely audible beneath the din, a record spun on a gramophone, sending out soft music. A few couples danced, arms around each other, under the smiling gaze of their comrades at the tables. For his part, Sharkey pushed his plate aside to write a few thoughtful words on the menu of a mate from his section. In return, the other man did the same for him, writing “Good luck”—a simple expression, but one that suited the life awaiting them back in the Dominion. Others, less inclined to write, added only their signature as a farewell.

A little more than three years after the company had left for the war, the <em>Ionic</em> dropped anchor in Auckland Bay at 9&nbsp;p.m. on 23&nbsp;April. Sharkey and his companions crowded onto the deck to catch sight of the city. But in the darkness, only the faint glow of streetlamps shimmered on the water. Given the late hour, disembarkation was postponed until the next day. That morning, Sharkey was repacking a few belongings when the blast of a foghorn sent him rushing to the porthole. A steam ferry was approaching the <em>Ionic</em>. On board, a crowd was calling out to the liner’s passengers while waving small flags. Rousing his cabinmates, Sharkey bolted outside. Like children, the little group ran up the stairs to the deck four steps at a time. Already, tunnellers and soldiers were answering the cheers rising from the ferry. Relatives had managed to come alongside the <em>Ionic</em> before she even berthed, to welcome the demobilised men[^18]. Cheers rose even louder when a plane, flying low over the ship, dropped small slips of paper. Sharkey, who caught one in mid-air, read a welcome message. On its second pass, the aircraft released confetti of every colour, to the passengers’ roaring delight. At last, the <em>Ionic</em> moved slowly in toward the harbour. In her wake, the foghorns of every vessel at anchor—large and small—began to sound. Cannon shots boomed in the distance[^19].

While the port of Auckland celebrated the arrival of the demobilised men, the military authorities had approved the dissolution of the Tunnelling Company. Despite the recognition it had earned from senior British commanders for its work, there were no plans to incorporate the small unit into the regular army. On the one hand, its numbers could not be sustained. Many industries, alerted to the tunnellers’ return, were eagerly awaiting their former employees’ return to work. On the other hand, funds were lacking—not only to keep the company in being, but also to maintain the level of excellence within its ranks. Training regular professional soldiers was therefore deemed sufficient to preserve the arts of sapping and mining within the engineer corps. Although the unit had existed only briefly, its story lived on in each of its members. Scattered as they were across New Zealand, the men closed the parenthesis that had carried them to the other side of the world.
