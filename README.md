The project is dedicated to a New Zealand special military unit who fought in France during the First World War (1914-1918): the _New Zealand Tunnelling Company_.

This company was formed at a time where the British Army struggled in their underground battle against the German miners beneath the no man's land. The web application tells the original story of this special unit and shares the men's war experience.

This project is built using Next.js, MySQL, Typescript and Sass. Testing is performed using React Testing Library and Playwright. Deployment is managed through GitHub Actions and custom server on share hosting platform.
