The project is a [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) web application dedicated to a New Zealand special military unit who fought in France during the First World War (1914-1918): the _New Zealand Tunnelling Company_.

This company was formed at a time where the British Army struggled in their underground battle against the German miners beneath the no man's land. The [web application](https://www.nztunnellers.com) tells the original story of this special unit and shares the men's war experience.
