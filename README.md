The project is a [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) web application dedicated to a New Zealand special military unit who fought in France during the First World War (1914-1918): the _New Zealand Tunnelling Company_.

This company was formed at a time where the British Army struggled in their underground battle against the German miners beneath the no man's land. The [web application](https://www.nztunnellers.com) tells the original story of this special unit and shares the men's war experience.

## Database

### Overview

The web application uses a PostgreSQL database which could be used to manage data for the entire web application. However, this is currently restricted to the data related to the tunnellers.

<div style="border: 2px solid #0066cc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
    ⓘ Vercel limits the database usage. For more information, <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/usage-and-pricing">see Vercel Postgres Pricing</a>. Therefore, we have tried to limit the call to the database as much as possible.
